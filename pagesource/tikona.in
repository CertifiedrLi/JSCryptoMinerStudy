I have been using tikona’s service for over a year now. I had chosen the 4 mbps speed because I download a lot of files and I need good speed. The internet speed has been constant and without any issues. Even though it is a wireless connection, there has been no drop in download speeds. And the best part is you get this plan at a very affordable price. No other ISP will give you that. If you are looking for good download speed and reliable internet connection then I would recommend to opt for Tikona Digital Networks.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-title"> <span class="field-content">by Krishna Jain</span></div></div></div><div id="views_slideshow_cycle_div_reviews_testimonial-block_reviews_slider_8" class="views-slideshow-cycle-main-frame-row views_slideshow_cycle_slide views_slideshow_slide views-row-9 views_slideshow_cycle_hidden views-row-odd"><div class="views-slideshow-cycle-main-frame-row-item views-row views-row-8 views-row-odd"><div class="views-field views-field-body"><div class="field-content"><p>Hi, wanted to say that the customer service by Tikona was very good.
