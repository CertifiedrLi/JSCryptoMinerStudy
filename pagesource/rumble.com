The tot and the family boxer are down the path for an everlasting friendship and they look so adorable together!

This 5-month baby has a very unusual best friend that adores her. The parents say that the dog stays with their baby all the time and <a href=" https://rumble.com/v31c8n-baby-belly-guard-dog.html" target="_blank">protects</a> her. There are times when she is unhappy and she is crying, so when that happens, the dog named Prince is always there to cheer her up! They even said that he tried to give his own food in order to please the young lady. What a gentleman! 

Footage occurred on January 31, 2018 in Nykil, Sweden and was filmed by baby's mother, and features the big and energetic pooch can be seen with a toy in his mouth waiting for his little friend to play with him. All that jumping and prancing seems to be so funny to the young toddler, so she laughs in her baby <a href=" https://rumble.com/v2zgbo-chihuahua-learned-to-bounce-a-newborn-baby-girl-in-her-bouncer.html" target="_blank">bouncer</a>. You can see by the reaction she has, the baby girl loves her dog so much! Her laughter is pure music to our ears!

The mother said: ‘My boxer Prince loves our 5-month-old baby. He protects her and is faithful to her in all situations. He even tries to give her his food, and if she cries he tries to comfort her as well.’

Thus video is guaranteed to make your day!

It’s possible that this is just an effect caused by exposure in the old camera, given the age of the photograph. However, it is strange how the ghostly face is more in focus than the rest of the family, bathing in a spooky shadow. 

A picture was taken of a man lying on a grave, but if <a href="https://rumble.com/v3d6zk-20-real-photos-you-have-to-look-at-twice.html" target="_blank">you better review the photo</a> you would notice that just above the uncle is a white presence of some kind. It looks at though it’s leaning over the man. 

Another haunting photo was taken in London in 1925 depicting melted wax mannequins removed from a fire that ripped through Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum. Witnesses reported that the wax statues were still fizzing from the intense heat of the fire.

Photo taken at an abandoned church shows the words ‘Dare you, dare you, double dare you’ written on a wall. The arrows appear to be pointing into an old ventilation duct leading to another room. Some remember that this is the same phrasing used in one of the Silent Hill movies, so it might just be the work of copycat pranksters. However, how much money would you need to be paid to crawl into the creepy little room? Let us know in the comments section below!

What do you think of these disturbing images? Is it just a camera malfunction or has <a href="https://rumble.com/v40c57-10-photos-you-have-to-see-2-times-to-understand.html" target="_blank">this photo captured something far more mysterious</a>?

The snow can make things harder for animals to find food. In this video, one rabbit and one squirrel know that only one soul can get to the bird feeder to eat and it's not going to be birds. Watch as they take turns intimidating each other and attempting to scare the other away. We hear them communicate, but who knows what they might be saying?!
 
Moving backwards, to the left and then to the right, the squirrel makes the bunny to jump into the air. The rodent then makes a sudden move, as if it is about to strike his opponent. This makes the  <a href=" https://rumble.com/v2zm2b-coco-bunny-love-to-hand-wash-with-his-human.html" target="_blank">bunny</a> jump high into the air many times while squeaking loudly. The rabbit doesn’t want to be defeated, so he moves forward to the squirrel which frantically jumps up. Then seconds later, the rodent decides to give up the fight and dashes away.

However, the footage ends up with the cute animals walking around the bird feeder, having their  <a href=" https://rumble.com/v347qa-bonobo-siblings-play-fight.html" target="_blank">fight</a> unresolved. This funny moment was captured from behind a window of a house, which was very close to the battlefield. During the whole video, you can hear a woman laughing at the animals’ fighting performance. It is believed that this video has been shot somewhere in the UK and it was later uploaded online. It became viral very quickly because many people love the drama these lovely animals have demonstrated on camera!

Watch this cute video of a standoff between a rabbit and squirrel and see how it all ends up!

The seven meter-long female known as Deep Blue stunned the world last year when video was unveiled of it dwarfing cage divers off the coast of Guadalupe   Island, Mexico. 

Now, diving enthusiast Michael   Maier, 48, has released even more eye-catching clips of the <a href="https://rumble.com/v3t581-great-white-shark-tries-to-attack-boat-in-australia.html" target="_blank">Great White shark</a> feeding on bait and inquisitively circling divers. Deep Blue, who is estimated to be at least 50 years old, was filmed by Michael in November 2013 - but these latest files were previously unseen.

The seasoned diver released even more eye-catching clips of the <a href="https://rumble.com/v3hotn-huge-shark-repeatedly-attacks-fishermen-in-canoe.html" target="_blank">huge shark</a> as it was feeding on a bait and circling the divers in a cage. “When we entered the water we had to wait because there was nothing to see. All of a sudden out of the deep blue, there she came. We realized almost immediately that she was very big." says Michael.

“She was very calm and not at all nervous and was circling us. She was very interested and was looking at us. During the circles we realized just how big she was - she must have been something like seven meters long. Everything was very well prepared. The whole team felt safe."

The salesman from the Cologne area also described Deep Blue as graceful, rather than scary. He admitted that he loves that, no matter Deep Blue's massive force, it was quiet and beautiful to be with her in the water.

They aren’t just your average teens - Ryan Boz and Alexis Garrish devote hours of their weeks practicing their swing dance, which is pretty evident given this performance.

This is from way back in 2015, on the dance floor for the 2015 U.S. Open Swing Dance Championships in Burbank, California. The two, then 15-year-olds, chose “Shut Up And Dance” by Walk The Moon for their award winning <a href="https://rumble.com/v4ci8a-incredible-riverdance-performance.html" target="_blank">performance</a> and they left everyone present with their mouths hanging open. 

Such synergy! Such passion between the two! And look how happy they are to be doing what they love! 

One fun fact is that they had only been training together for a year before this coveted performance for the trophy in the young adults division. You guessed it, they took the trophy home and won the highest West Coast Swing Honor possible! Both Ryan and Alexis have been <a href="https://rumble.com/v33h8t-tony-tiles-in-motion.html" target="_blank">danging</a> most of their lives and they have been competing separately as wel.

Both their moms have been competing throughout the swing circuit for years against each other. Now they find themselves on the same team! 

Both teens have been trained in various forms of dance. Ryan has been familiarized with Hip Hop, Shag and West Coast Swing, while Alexis knows Tap, Jazz, Ballet, Lyrical and Hip Hop since the age of 5. Alexis is also a Varsity Pom Squad Member, as well as a coach for the local Pony Poms Squad.

Check out this first-place performance! Credit to 'Debbie Ramsey Boz'.

We might see them as the most adorable softies that we would like to cuddle forever and ever, but they are a bunch of tough iron-willed individuals. Watch as 8-month-old baby Hadley shows off a muscle flex with dad while getting ready for a bath. Now that's a cute moment! We’re just glad that her parents thought to <a href="https://rumble.com/v4eflr-baby-sneezes.html" target="_blank">record</a> the hilarity of the situation.

Even though she is only 8 months old, baby Hadley is already one tough little lady! If you need proof, just check out this video of Hadley and her dad measuring each other’s gains! In their video that is steadily climbing the viral ladder, Hadley’s little arms are just the usual pinchable little nubs, but with dad’s encouragement, she’s probably seeing Wonder Woman in the mirror! Dad’s getting a workout as well, what with all the belly laughs he’s getting! Little Hadley can’t stop humoring her dad by flexing her arms in front of her. Little does she know that she looks like the cutest ballerina preparing to do a plie, rather than a weightlifter, but we don’t mind one bit.

A <a href="https://rumble.com/v32pl7-baby-adorably-disagrees-with-dad.html" target="_blank">dad</a> is precious to every girl, because they can teach them about self-sufficiency and toughness, among many other qualities. They can help them fight the wrongs and do the right s in this world. Looks like Hadley will have no problem with either one! Good job, dad!

There are no trees inside, so that you can scratch your butt on their lovely bark and your owner just lounges there on the sofa, instead of running to your aid. What are you going to do?

You find the closest thing that you can fit snugly in and use the edge to shimmy that itch off! An <a href="https://rumble.com/v3v8sb-ikea-glass-table-top-exploded-ohio-woman-says.html" target="_blank">IKEA table</a> fits the description perfectly! If only that thing was not so damn light but with an itch so strong not even the heaviest table would help!

Cooper the English <a href="https://rumble.com/v2zzg9-english-bulldog-crying-during-bath-time..html" target="_blank">bulldog</a>  tries to fit underneath one such IKEA table, so that he might use the table’s edge to scratch his butt. But it turns out he's just too big for it. Everything that was on the table is sent flying off. Despite the powerless scream of his owner, he just cannot help it because when the sensation which causes the desire or reflex to scratch calls, there is nothing you can do but take the challenge, even if it means knocking everything around you on the floor. And why bother anyway when there is somebody to take care of the scattered things? 

Not only did he blow everything off, but the yelling got Copper so confused, that with his attempts to get unstuck from underneath, he knocked the table lamp, the DVD player and the TiVo! That clumsy dog, he is making us rewind the video over and over again just to relish in his hilarious misdeed!

The collie crossbreed is the epitome of “saving the day” and “always coming home”. She was always there to help her owners whichever way they required, being the gentle and comprehensive animal that her writer made her out to be. The  truth isn’t too far behind either. The Shetland Sheepdog, or <a href="https://rumble.com/v3jhcp-navigating-sheltie.html" target="_blank">Sheltie</a> for short, is an excellent family companion and, with herding in its blood, it will try to herd everyone it finds itself responsible of, even its owner’s children. 

In this adorable video, unfortunately, no one is herding anyone. It is quite the opposite - the Sheltie is guiding his very young human through the process of rolling over!

Link the Shetland service dog teaches baby Holland how to roll over by example. How amazing is that? The two lay on their bellies, facing each other when Link decides that now is the best time to show the tiny <a href="https://rumble.com/v34rfi-baby-babbles-a-good-argument.html" target="_blank">baby girl</a> how a proper roll-over is done. He does it in one swift movement, proving he is obviously a pro at it and then stands still and waits for his pupil to follow suit.

Holland seems a bit confused and uncertain of her abilities to repeat the action but decides it is now or never. Dressed in her super-adorable onesie, Holland tips to the right and makes a half roll-over. 

The mom is the most impressed with her little ones’ actions. Holland may not have done the entire roll-over, but she will get there eventually.

And then comes the topic for the Rubik’s cube. We cannot even attempt to solve a Rubik’s Cube, but we are seriously amazed that there are people out there who can do it so easily. We’ve been told that there are little steps and patterns to follow in order to solve one, and if you do it successfully once, you can keep practicing until you solve it with ease. But, no use. It’s too complicated, we give up. However, there are some people who had mastered the <a href="https://rumble.com/v2zuhq-skydiver-solves-Rubik's-cube-while-free-falling.html" target="_blank">Rubik’s cube</a> and are champions in solving it! Literally! 

Minh Thai is a Vietnamese-American speedcuber. As a sixteen-year-old student, he won the first <a href="https://rumble.com/v36nd5-fibo-2017-jumpplus-world-adrienn-banhegyi-kata-banhegyi-dominika-kruck-nick.html" target="_blank">World chamionship</a> in 1982 in Budapest, Hungary with a best single of 22.95 seconds using a corners first method. Simply amazing! 1979 was the year he came to the USA from Vietnam as a refugee, without knowing any word English! Seven days after buying a Cube in June 1981, he could do it in under two minutes. Now, years have passed from his youth and glory. However, we have this video proving to all of us that he's still got some talent left after all these years. 

Do you think we can ask him for a tutorial? It’s really mesmerizing to watch him. Well, it looks like he needs a thunderclap!</p></div></div><footer class="video-post-footer"><address class="author"><a href="https://rumble.com/user/Luis/">Luis</a></address><abbr class="published">Published: November  5, 2015</abbr><span class="views">180,675 views</span></footer></div></article><article class="video-post"><a class="video-thumbnail icon-play-btn" href="https://rumble.com/v302m2-old-man-farm-ram-tries-to-play-with-guard-dogs..html"><img src="https://i.rmbl.ws/s8/1/6/a/p/t/6apta.oq1b.1-small-Old-Man-Farm-Ram-tries-to-p.jpg" alt="Curious Ram Joins In On Playtime With Guard Dogs" /><span class="video-time">1m02s</span></a><div class="video-details"><div class="video-info"><header><h2 class="video-title"><a href="https://rumble.com/v302m2-old-man-farm-ram-tries-to-play-with-guard-dogs..html">Curious Ram Joins In On Playtime With Guard Dogs</a></h2></header><div class="video-description"><p>There’s a very curious and brave ram that resides in Nova Scotia, Canada. Nova Scotia is a small province off the coast of Atlantic Canada that is home to one of the most interesting rams out there. You see, there is something very special about this ram. This fluffy sheep with long fur and split hooves has a desire unlike any other: just to be one of the dogs. So, with that in mind, when he spots a group of guard dogs, he cannot help but walk up and try to ease his way into the ‘conversation, making attempts just to fit in. And by that, we mean playtime. 

It is funny that in the animal kingdom we have seen some very interesting interspecies animal friendships before, we have seen a lot of unlikely best friend pairings: like a monkey and a lion cub or a dolphin and a seal but this has got to be one of the cutest! Well, these animals are connected, nonetheless. The reaction that follows by the three pups as they invite their furry friend in is classic animal love. This unusual interaction is adorable.  

At first, the <a href=" https://rumble.com/v3w0bz-ram-steals-food-from-family.html" target="_blank">ram</a> is standing on the outside, getting ready to approach the dogs by making some marks with the hooves in the snow. Then, he steadily advances towards one of the dogs and wait for its reaction. When he realizes that he can have some fun with the dog, he does not want to spare a second anymore and goes closer to it. The dog gets to know his ram friend by sniffing his fur and only when there are no imposing threats on either side, the hopping game may start. And with a jump they move forwards and backwards, the <a href=" https://rumble.com/v4cb13-dog-says-im-sorry.html” target="_blank">dog</a> extending its legs like it wants to say hi. With one final playful bite, the game is over.
