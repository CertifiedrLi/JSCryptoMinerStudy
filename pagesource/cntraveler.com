The roads, usually chock-full of zig-zagging motorbikes, will be deserted; the temples, where daily processions and rituals are commonplace, will go quiet; cellphones, in a country with over 170 million users, will be stowed away; and homes, where you'd once see TVs flickering and hear radios blaring, will go dark and silent.

Those in Bali, the only Hindu-majority island in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-you-should-visit-indonesia-in-2017"},"Indonesia"],", observe the religious holiday through following four tenants: No fire (and in this age of electricity that means no lights, either); no working; no traveling; and no entertainment. Some take the day to fast, as well. Families stay at home, lights dimmed or off, from six a.m. until six a.m. the following day, in silence besides the occasional whisper. It's believed that if you break the silence, you attract the (very much unwanted) attention of demons who roam the island on that day."],["p","More importantly, it's not voluntary or only observed by Hindu residents. The only people you'll see on the streets, if you have the nerve to venture outside of your hotel, are the ",["em","pecalang"],", local authorities who enforce the rules of Nyepi and who won't hesitate to slap you with a fine and send you straight back to where you came from if they see you breaking them—and that includes tourists. Emergency services are the only ones to be given a pass during the 24 hours."],["p","While hotels and resorts stay open, guests have to remain on the premises, and it's worth checking with the front desk about what services will be offered that day, as it can vary depending on their policies. As has happened in years past, Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport will halt operations for 24 hours (no traveling, remember?), affecting at least 482 flights, according to ",["a",{"href":"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/14/bali-airport-to-close-for-24-hours-for-nyepi.html"},"the ",["em","Jakarta Post"]],"."],["p","For the first time this year, cell phone providers are doing their part to observe Nyepi, too.

But, for many, it can actually be a welcome chance to disconnect and witness a centuries-old tradition on an island where religion and ceremony play a pivotal role in daily life (Bali's nicknamed The Island of the Gods for good reason)."],["p","Plus, the observance of Nyepi is actually sandwiched between two celebratory days that can be a wonder to behold, especially when placed in contrast to the total shut-down of Nyepi. The day before Nyepi, observers perform the Bhuta Yajna ceremony, in which giant (and, frankly, terrifying) effigies of demons are paraded through the streets and then burned, as a way to vanquish any negative spirits leftover from the year before. And on the day after Nyepi, businesses reopen as people emerge from their homes en masse to visit relatives and ask forgiveness for past deeds, refreshed after a day away from their jobs, phones, and the general flurry of daily life."]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channel":[{"id":"5a2ee221afedd54e712fa5f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Intel","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-intel"},{"id":"5a2ee27c37dada794e16bd1b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Latest","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-latest"}]},"channel":"Travel Intel","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"56c38c95243f42e312eb08ad","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Prior to joining *Condé Nast Traveler*, Sebastian worked at MTV and MIT, among other places, and spent a year documenting local hip-hop as a Fulbright Fellow in Botswana.

African officials announced last week that \"Day Zero\"—the day when residents' taps would run dry in Cape Town as a result of the worst drought in more than a century—has been postponed, at least until 2019. The deferment is in part due to the city's intense conservation efforts over the last year, water donations from surrounding areas, and the scheduled opening of desalination plants. Better still: It rained last night, hard. \"We've often joked about how during our incredibly mild winter months or in wet weather, we loathe going out for fear of getting rained on. Last night was different. There were people out and about everywhere, without umbrellas and with smiles,\" Cape Town native and resident Nicole Biondi said."],["p","The city has been under severe water restrictions since alarm bells started going off in May 2017, limiting personal usage to 13 gallons a day. By comparison, Americans use on average more than six times that amount each day. So far, the restrictions have worked. City officials announced that residents had reduced water use from nearly 317 million gallons a day in 2015 to just 136 million a day in February 2018. But the city doesn't plan to lift the limits and encourage locals to water their lawns just because \"Day Zero\" has been postponed. The restrictions apply to resident and visitors alike, and will remain in place as Cape Town hopes to knock its water consumption down to 118 million gallons a day. \"Capetonians have pulled together and managed to avoid a potential crisis. The initiatives that people have come up with to save water at their home and work places are incredible. People from all over the world are looking toward Cape Town to learn how they can implement this in other parts of the world,\" said Lindsy Teller, sales and marketing manager at Ellerman House. Despite the panic and government finger-pointing the water crisis faced, Cape Town's turnaround is impressive.
