Thanks, MobyMax!","author":"Michelle Gross, Spencer County Middle"},{"quote":"After using MobyMax for a year, I absolutely can't believe how affordable this impressive program is. I had students who made it to above grade-level in core subjects because of MobyMax. MobyMax empowers Response to Intervention (RTI) and engages high performers. The student growth I saw this year makes MobyMax invaluable.","author":"Tim Swanson, Oak Heights Elementary"},{"quote":"Moby is very affordable! It is not only reasonably priced but is huge bang for your buck. The tablets are a great deal, too. And customer service, which is a free phone call, has always been friendly and outstanding. I use a lot of educational software, and Moby is hands down the best value I've seen.","author":"Deb Mueller, Stamford Central"},{"quote":"I gave MobyMax a try because it was free, but I have kept using it because it is GREAT! It is amazing what all you get for free; my administrator was so impressed during a walk-through that she offered to purchased the Pro version! MobyMax is amazing!","author":"Tracy Belfield, South Middle School"},{"quote":"I loved that I could try Moby first and decide if it was for me. I can say it did not take long to realize that I needed to purchase. I was speechless when I saw the price, and so was my principal. It was the easiest purchase to get approved ever because it offers so much for such a low price. You just can't say no!","author":"Amy Glover, Casey Middle School"},{"quote":"Moby is a great deal compared to some of the other e-learning sites, especially when you look at all you're getting for the price. It took very little convincing to get our purchasing team to see that we were not just paying for ONE module, but ALL of them! Well worth the money!","author":"John Blake, Ed.S., Woodlake Elementary School"},{"quote":"When another teacher told me about MobyMax's free trial, I was amazed at what her students were doing for FREE!  It wasn't complicated to enroll, and there were no unexpected surprises like some sites.  The word spread in our building, and our administration got excited and purchased the full program. It made my job so much easier!","author":"Pat Evans, Nova Elementary"},{"quote":"With Moby, I didn't have to write a requisition and send it through channels, waiting on bent knee for the request to be blessed by the powers that be...all I had to do was sign up!! It is a FREE, valuable tool that helps me meet the needs of my students. Thanks!!","author":"Carolyn Brown, Peakview School"},{"quote":"As an Intensive teacher, I have to find materials that are not exactly what's use in other classes, which leaves us improvising often. Students like technology, and they love going at their own pace. This fits the bills and is the right price. Affordable and effective! Thanks MobyMax!","author":"Carolyn Arndt Morris, Glenridge Middle"},{"quote":"Before we found Moby, my school had subscriptions to more costly websites that were not as engaging, fun, or educational. Overall, Moby is the best site I have ever used with my students!","author":"Jaclyn Wernersbach, Eisenhower School"},{"quote":"What makes Moby such a good value? IT'S REASONABLY PRICED and a GREAT PROGRAM!! It is nice to find a program that has both a good price and great content. It is definitely rare, and I am happy our school has implemented it. I would recommend Moby to any and all!","author":"Dakota Bahlau, George Long Elementary"}]},{"category":"popular","tagline":"Used in over half the elementary schools in the US.","quotes":[{"quote":"MobyMax is a program that has changed the way I teach. My students are motivated to reach their goals, fill their fact bars, and earn badges. The program is fun and engaging for all!","author":"Sara Laing, Plunkett Elementary"},{"quote":"Can't beat the price! With all the cutbacks we have faced in the classroom, this is the most economical way to help students build skills quickly while having fun.","author":"Melanie Gomez, Vernon Middle School"},{"quote":"My school used to subscribe to another online program that was very costly. When we were introduced to MobyMax, a free program, we quickly realized that it offered differentiated learning aligned to the Common Core standards that was far more superb than any other program out there. Nothing compares!","author":"Jaime Larson, Carolyn Wenz Elementary"},{"quote":"With dwindling budgets, free resources are a must. Moby provides my kiddos with great practice that is tailored to their needs. They can practice at school, at home, and during the summer. Thanks, Moby, for providing such a powerful tool for everyone to use for FREE!","author":"Laura Halcomb, Alvaton Elementary School"},{"quote":"When my friend told me about MobyMax, I couldn't believe it was free!  When I tried it out for myself, I knew I had to spread the word.  Other websites that cost a ton don't even compare to MobyMax.  It is high-quality, fun learning for free!  Why not try it out for yourself?","author":"Holly O'Connell, Pinewood Elementary School"},{"quote":"My students get so excited when they come into the classroom to find 'MobyMax' on the agenda board.  My students use the Messenger to tell me about something really cool that they learned while reading their passages, and they also send tons of messages thanking me for allowing them to use Moby to improve their reading and comprehension skills!","author":"McKenzie Sluder, Hudson Middle School"},{"quote":"When I asked my Kindergarten students why they LOVED our Moby Tablet, their first response was that it helped them learn! Digging deeper, one student said, 'When I use our Moby Tablet, I feel like I am learning in a whole different world!  There were so many things that I learned...it even helped me write my first book!'","author":"Andrea Good, Bell Prairie Elementary"},{"quote":"My first grade students beg to go to the computer lab the 'play' MobyMax! It's a fun experience for them, and the data and feedback I get back is instrumental in driving standards-based instruction!","author":"Chelsea Davis, Life School "},{"quote":"With MobyMax, every learner travels a truly differentiated path to success. Moby assesses where they are and takes them on a journey, starting at a developmentally appropriate level and building from there. Below-level? On- level? Advanced? Moby aids them all!","author":"Rosemary Taff, Grove Lower Elementary"},{"quote":"Students get excited when they see their progress in real time.  It is amazing because the student, parents and teachers can all follow the student's progress. What a motivator! Moby gives tangible proof of success! Everybody wins!","author":"Connie Pritt, Children's Home School"},{"quote":"I am completely enamored with the Mobymax Vocabulary section. The program is famous among my plethora of students for being 'easy' and fun. I just adore their zest for learning and seeing them use new words!","author":"Lauren Francis, Gregorio T.
