<h2>November 7th, 2017</h2>
<h1>Dark Legacy Comics is on Patreon!</h1>

<p>I have officially started a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/darklegacycomics">DLC Patreon page</a>. For those of you that don't know, Patreon is a membership platform that provides tools for creators to run a subscription content service. Basically, for paying a monthly fee, you can gain access to additional Dark Legacy Comics content. For those of you that have no interest in giving me money, don't worry, I will continue to post free comics weekly, you can stop reading now.</p>

<p>I've always wanted to offer more with DLC than just a weekly comic, and hopefully this can help make it happen. Currently there is only one tier ($1 a month), just to gauge how much interest there is in this idea. This tier includes access to my Patreon activity stream which will include my weekly comic posts with my added commentary. I'm going to be active on the posts, so you can also join in on the conversation with me, ask questions, etc.</p>

<p>My goal for the future is to offer more rewards for patrons. One idea may be to have patrons vote on their favorite old comic each week, and I will redraw the comic. Or perhaps do a <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/specials/3">fan written comic</a> like the one I did on Facebook a few years back. I'd love to hear your ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your support, and hopefully we can keep Dark Legacy Comics going for another 10 years!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/darklegacycomics">Check out the Patreon page here.</a></p>

<h1>I Had a BABY</h1>

<p>Sorry everyone, I made an offspring, so I will be taking a few weeks of paternity leave from the comics. Hopefully by then he will be old enough to play a simple character, like a Hunter, at which point he'll be distracted enough that I can draw again.</p>

<p>I would draw a picture of a baby as the header for this story, but I'm too exhausted. This is the best I can do: (ಥ‸ಥ)</p>

<p>Now that I have an extra mouth to feed, let me shamelessly plug my app again:</p>

            <h1>Moving On</h1>

            <p>It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you all that I will be giving up on my comic work in order to pursue my dream of drawing clip art for mundane inanimate objects.</p>
            <p>Now I know this may upset some of you, but I think the work really speaks for itself, and I believe you may even come to prefer this new passion of mine overy my dull regular story-based humor.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/index/AF1.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Well said, small wooden ball!</p>

            <p><img src="/images/index/AF2.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Holy shit. Is that a glue-gun glue stick?! I mean, that's only the third most requested glue-gun related object in all of clip-art history!</p>

            <p>Maybe this isn't your style. Understood. Perhaps you're more in the market for clip-art of once common items now in decline...</p>
            <p><img src="/images/index/AF3.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Clip-art of film cannister and film cannister cap sold seperately.</p>

            <p>Whether you want aluminum foil, a pink eraser, a hex-bolt, a purple crayon, a bendy straw, or even an off-brand battery, I GOT YOU COVERED.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/index/AF4.jpg" /></p>

            <p>Want a bucket? No problem!</p>
            <p><img src="/images/index/AF5.jpg" /></p>

            <p>Need some context? Hell, why not a bucket filled with water on top of a door!</p>
            <p><img src="/images/index/AF6.jpg" /></p>

            <p><img src="/images/index/AF7.jpg" /></p>

            <p>HAHA SUCK IT NARYA, APRIL FOOLS!</p>
            <p><img src="/images/index/AF8.jpg" /></p>

            <p>Maybe I'm the fool.</p>
			<p>On a serious note, I will be on vacation this week visiting a brand new nephew, thus there will be no comic this Sunday. See you all in a week!</p>

<h1>Get Your Donald Shirt!</h1>
<p><img src="/images/index/donaldshirt.jpg" /><a href="http://teespring.com/c-a-t-spells-cat"><img src="/images/index/donaldshirt.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Donald shirts are now available!</p>
<p>Once again, I will be using <a href="http://teespring.com/c-a-t-spells-cat">Teespring</a>, which uses the crowdfunding model (like kickstarter) to create custom T-shirts.</p>
<p>Like most crowdfunding models, we have a goal which must be met in order for our product to be produced. The goal is simple. 150 t-shirts. If we sell them all, our goal is reached and the shirts will be printed. When the campaign ends, the shirts will no longer be available, so <a href="http://teespring.com/c-a-t-spells-cat">buy them while you can</a>!</p>
<p>This time the design is available in multiple different shirt brands, cuts and quality. Some shirt brand/cuts are more expensive to produce than others, which is why you may see some differences in prices. I know many of you are on a tight budget, so I wanted to make sure that a cheaper option was available. The multiple brands also give us a wider variation of colors.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:keydar@darklegacycomics.com">email</a> or message me on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DarkLegacyComics">Facebook page</a></p>
<p>Let's do this!</p><h2>Aug 23rd, 2015</h2>
<h1>I Got Married!</h1>
<p>There will be no comic this weekend, due to my getting married.</p>
<p><img src="/images/index/wedding.png" /></p>
<p>I know, I know, crappy excuse.</p>
			<p>Next week I will have recovered from this post marriage exhaustion, and #502 will return as normal.</p>
<p>See you next Sunday!</p>
<p>-Keydar</p><h2>July 16th, 2015</h2>
            <h1>Off Again</h1>
            <p>I will be vacationing out of town this weekend, and thus comic #498: "Patchwork: Part Three" will be postponed until the 26th.</p>
            <p>Last time I took a week off, I provided you all with an old alternate version of comic #70. Thus, I figured the least I could do was scrounge up some old discarded comic material
            from the past.</p>
            <p> This alternate ending comes from <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/100">comic #100</a>. Initially, I was going to end it with Donald taking a drink:
            <p><img src="/images/index/donaldyoung.jpg" /></p>
			<p>I had always intended to reveal Donald as really being a priest, rather than a warrior, but never really got around to it until much later (see comics #<a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/298">298</a>, <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/354">354</a>, and <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/382">382</a>).</p>
			<p>Many have been asking me about the current ongoing story line. As you may have noticed, I tend to have a habit of writing stories to celebrate every 100 comics. The "Patchwork" story will be a 5-parter, with the last episode of the story ending on comic #500. Comic 501 will continue as usual.</p>
            <p>I will see you all for part three on the 26th!</p>
            <p>-Keydar</p><h2>Apr 12th, 2015</h2>
<h1>Off This Week</h1>
<p>Just wanted to let you all know that I will be taking this week off. I moved in to a new apartment yesterday and I still have a TON of stuff to set up.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I looked deep into my backups, and found an old discarded version of <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/70">comic #70</a> from December, 2006. I never finished fully coloring it, but enjoy!</p>
<p><img src="/comics/70_alternate.jpg" /></p>
<p>See you next week!</p><h2>Nov 12th, 2014</h2>
<h1>Streaming Warlords of Draenor Expansion</h1>
<p class="update">Update - Nov 14: Unfortunately, I've run in to a few technical issues, so I'm going to have to put the streaming on hold for the time being until I iron them out.</p>
<p>As you may remember, I streamed the WoD alpha briefly back in June, and I am planning on doing something similar for the WoD live release this week.</p>
<p>I have purposefully avoided learning as much information about the expansion as possible, as I tend to enjoy the game more when I discover the features for myself. Thus, you will likley see me bumbling around like an idiot, leveling inefficiently, gaping mindlessly at pretty new content, and wasting time trying to understand simple features.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds appealing to you, please stop by and chat! Even if it is just to inform me of how to do things correctly.</p>

<h1>Warlords of Draenor Alpha Stream</h1>
<p>So, a few people have expressed interest in me doing a live stream.</p>
<p>Normally, because I can't think of anything more boring than watching me play poorly, I would say no. However, since I have access to the WoD alpha, I figured that might be at least somewhat interesting to some people. You can also just stop by to chat, if you have no interest in the stream itself.</p>
<p>Again, I make no promises for it being exciting.</p>

<p>As you can see, I've updated the coding of the website a bit. As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions. </p>
<p>There are bound to be bugs, so please do not hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:keydar@darklegacycomics.com">report them</a>. I am only one person, and despite what you may have intuited from my many years of perfection, I am in fact capable of error.</p>

<h1>ONE WEEK LEFT!</h1>
<p class="update">**Update Mar 2014: The campaign has ended, thank you all so much for your support!**</p>
<p>You have one week left to buy your <a href="http://teespring.com/Clone_Grenades">Clone Shirts</a> before they are GONE!</p>
<p>Look, even Keydar is wearing one!</p>
<p><a href="http://teespring.com/Clone_Grenades"><img src="/images/index/keydar_clone_shirt.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Remember, we have to sell all 150 shirts or they won't get printed. Tell your friends!</p>

            <h1>The Clone Shirts are Back in 5 colors!</h1>
            <p><a href="http://teespring.com/Clone_Grenades"><img src="/images/index/tshirt_3.jpg" /></a></p>
            <p>By popular demand, the clone shirts are back!</p>
            <p>Once again, I will be using <a href="http://teespring.com/Clone_Grenades">Teespring</a>, which uses the crowdfunding model (like kickstarter) to create custom T-shirts.</p>
            <p>Like most crowdfunding models, we have a goal which must be met in order for our product to be produced. The goal is simple. 150 t-shirts. If we sell them all, our goal is reached and the shirts will be printed. When the campaign ends, the shirts will no longer be available, so <a href="http://teespring.com/Clone_Grenades">buy them while you can</a>!</p>
            <p>This time the shirt is available in 5 different colors based on your suggestions on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DarkLegacyComics">Facebook page</a>. I am also selecting a better quality shirt, and I will NOT be raising the price.</p>
            <p>Let's make this happen for the second time!</p>        </div>
