We may also use this information to maintain our services; to customize our service to meet your needs; to process transactions and donations; to collect fees or other charges; to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent transactions; to provide customer support; and to contact you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services and other information we believe you\u2019d find valuable.<\/p>\n\n<h3>When %{appName} shares information<\/h3>\n\n<p>Our policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when we have your permission to do so.  Occasionally, we may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, donation trends, user growth, etc.) with our partners and other interested parties.

You and %{appName} agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual basis.<\/li>\n    <li>For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within San Francisco County, California (the \"Forum\"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and %{appName} waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.<\/li>\n    <li>In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>NO CLASS ACTIONS. We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: (a) neither you nor %{appName} can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other %{appName} users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users. If a court decides that this subsection on \"No Class Actions\" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire section covering Disputes will be null and void, but, the rest of the terms of these Terms of Use will still apply.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Miscellaneous<\/h4>\n<p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

If you continue to use the Services after we change the Terms of Use, you accept all changes.
