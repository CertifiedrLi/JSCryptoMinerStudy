These studios controlled the financial and technical resources necessary to create content and, as a result, had enormous leverage over distributors: the movie theaters, television channels, video sellers, and other middlemen who delivered entertainment to consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this traditional environment, a merger between Time Warner (a leading content producer) and AT&amp;T (a dominant content distributor) could be a threat to competition. As the DOJ\u2019s complaint against the merger argues, the resulting conglomerate might \u201cuse its control of Time Warner\u2019s popular programming as a weapon to harm competition\u201d by raising the prices it charges other cable networks for Time Warner entertainment or limiting distribution of content from other producers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The problem with applying this narrative to today\u2019s market is that it ignores three recent transformations that have forever <a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/k_drCM8X8WFEMZ1kURc4qL?domain=wsj.com\"><span class=\"s2\">shifted power<\/span><\/a> in the entertainment industry. First, whereas studios once controlled the tools and resources necessary to create content, professional-level production tools are now available to anyone with a laptop and a few hundred dollars to spare. This democratization of content creation has resulted in an explosion of creative voices producing entertainment. Second, new channels have arisen to accommodate these new storytellers. Google\u2019s YouTube fostered a generation of homegrown stars, and streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon offer a wide array of original content. Whereas a handful of major television networks once decided what shows viewers would watch and when they would watch them, today\u2019s consumers can access almost any type of content they desire, at any time, on any device. Third, the digitization of content has led to widespread piracy, eroding the profitably of Hollywood\u2019s once stable business model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Together these changes have shifted market power away from the firms that own content toward the digital platforms that control a new scarce resource: the customer. The ability to command viewer attention and use data to better target and serve consumers is now the lifeblood of the entertainment industry. While content creators once held the power, they now serve as suppliers to the increasingly dominant digital distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why major studios that faced very little market entry for over a century are now confronting significant threats from firms like Netflix, Amazon (via Prime), and Google (via YouTube), as well as potential content plays from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:FB\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:AAPL\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> on the horizon. These technology companies are leveraging their control over consumer attention and customer data to vertically integrate upstream into content creation, spending billions per year on original content to compete head-to-head with the studios.

While quashing traditional media mergers like the one between AT&amp;T and Time Warner might produce greater competition and lower cable costs for a few years, it will cement control over the future of the entertainment industry in the hands of a few large technology companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The DOJ appears to be refereeing the game based on an old set of rules that no longer apply. While the agency is worried that the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger could increase the cost of basic cable for those consumers who have yet to cut the cord, they should be far more concerned about ensuring competition in the new online distribution space. Their myopic view of competition will ultimately harm consumers in the long run by preventing legacy firms from competing for customers in the new digital entertainment marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Michael D.

Bitcoin is a notoriously expensive business\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/07\/bitcoin-mining-costs-global-south-korea-venezuela\/\">recent calculations<\/a> by the lighting company Elite Fixtures suggest that it costs a fortune to mine one Bitcoin in some countries, with the cost being as much as $26,170 in South Korea.<\/p>\n<p>Now analysts at Fundstrat have said that it&#8217;s no longer particularly profitable to mine Bitcoin. &#8220;Bitcoin currently trades essentially at the break-even cost of mining a bitcoin,&#8221; the research house said in a Thursday report.<\/p>\n<h2>How does Bitcoin mining work?<\/h2>\n<p>Bitcoins are created when a &#8220;miner&#8221; (essentially, a node on the Bitcoin network that boasts very fast computers) beats other miners to package up the latest block of Bitcoin transactions and add it to Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain\u2014its famous shared ledger.<\/p>\n<p>The winner, who receives newly-minted Bitcoin as their reward, wins the race by providing the answer to a mathematical problem that is deliberately designed to use up a lot of computing power, in order to maintain stability in the speed at which these blocks are &#8220;found.&#8221; People often say the miners solve mathematical problems, but all they really do is repeatedly try to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuewalk.com\/2017\/12\/bitcoin-mining\/\">guess a lucky number<\/a>, as quickly as possible, using the brute force of powerful computers.<\/p>\n<h2>Why does Bitcoin mining cost so much?<\/h2>\n<p>Fundstrat&#8217;s model for calculating mining costs takes a few factors into account. The first is the cost of the computers themselves\u2014as the mathematical problems get progressively harder over time, miners need to keep upgrading their rigs. The second issue is energy. Making loads of incorrect guesses uses a lot of it. And then there&#8217;s cooling; all that energy use throws off a lot of heat. (Bitcoin is, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/15\/bitcoin-dirty-secret-energy-use-pollution\/\">terrible for the environment<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us back to Bitcoin&#8217;s profitability. This wasn&#8217;t a problem when the cryptocurrency was heading &#8220;to the Moon,&#8221; as enthusiasts were fond of putting it, but since late last year, Bitcoin has largely been heading in the other direction. Having <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/17\/bitcoin-record-high-short-of-20000\/\">gone to near $20,000<\/a> in mid-December, it&#8217;s currently worth little more than $8,200.<\/p>\n<p>According to Fundstrat, the current break-even point for Bitcoin mining is $8,038.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Miners contend with Bitcoin transaction fees<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/03\/15\/bad-news-for-bitcoin-miners-as-its-no-longer-profitable-to-create-the-cryptocurrency.html\">CNBC noted<\/a>, miners not only have to deal with increasing competition and a falling Bitcoin price\u2014they&#8217;re also being stung by another part of their revenue, transaction fees. While Bitcoin adherents cite low fees as an advantage of the cryptocurrency over traditional finance networks, the median fee for a transaction reached $34 in late December. Now it&#8217;s down below 50 cents.<\/p>\n<p>So is everyone going to give up and stop mining Bitcoin now? Not likely. Its profitability depends greatly on energy costs and, while Fundstrat&#8217;s model uses a global average of 6 cents per kilowatt hour, Chinese miners apparently only have to pay 4 cents or less.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not the activity still makes sense <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/07\/bitcoin-mining-costs-global-south-korea-venezuela\/\">really depends on where you are<\/a>.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 08:51:57","updated":"2018-03-16 08:51:57","minute":"8:51 AM

Patrick's Day","content":"<p>Walk into your local liquor store and you could be forgiven for thinking St. Patrick&#8217;s Day was created by Guinness. It&#8217;s the day for Ireland&#8217;s favorite beer to shine\u2014and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/09\/guinness-st-patricks-day-pints\/\">13 million pints<\/a> of the stout will be consumed in those 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Guinness, of course. (It&#8217;s delicious!) Nor is there anything wrong with Jameson, Ireland&#8217;s best known whisky. But if you want to have a St. Paddy&#8217;s Day celebration that stands out from the crowd, there are a few other options available to you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few you might not have been aware of.<\/p>\n<p><strong>O\u2019Hara\u2019s Irish Stout: <\/strong>Made by one of Ireland&#8217;s first craft brewers, this is an incredibly smooth, easy-drinking stout. It&#8217;s full-bodied and boasts a flavor profile that leans most heavily on the roasted, smoky flavors of the malt. You&#8217;ll pick up the slight hint of espresso, but not enough that it&#8217;s distracting. It has a crisp, dry finish that will leave you eager for more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Murphy&#8217;s Irish Red: <\/strong>Currently owned by Heinekin, Murphy&#8217;s is increasing the size of its footprint through the U.S. with many strong offerings. The Irish Red is a good choice for St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, with a dry, crisp, hoppy taste and plenty of carbonation. It&#8217;s a good choice for those who want to celebrate, but aren&#8217;t fans of stouts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kinnegar Brewing Scraggy Bay: <\/strong>This IPA&#8217;s going to be difficult to find, but if you get your hands on it, guard it jealously. Kennegar is a fairly young craft brewer based out of County Donegal that specializes in farmhouse ales. Their saisons are well done, but Scraggy Bay, a hoppy golden ale, is their most popular, offering citrus and floral notes all riding atop of slight bitterness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Knappogue Castle 12 Year: <\/strong>Prefer Irish whisky to beer? A boutique distillery with U.S. distribution, Knappogue&#8217;s signature single malt spends 12 years in bourbon barrels. It&#8217;s crisp with hints of both fruit and pepper and is good both neat and on the rocks. It&#8217;s a wonderful find for the discerning whisky enthusiast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bushmills Red Bush Irish Whiskey: <\/strong>Sometimes, you&#8217;re looking for a good whisky on a budget. Red Bush offers a quality taste for just $20 to $25 per bottle. The bourbon barrel profile is harder to pick out, but you&#8217;ll get a nice biscuity body with tropical fruit notes. There&#8217;s a spice to this one that might take some people off guard, but it&#8217;s a good blend that&#8217;s fine on its own or even better in cocktails.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 12:00:26","updated":"2018-03-16 12:00:26","minute":"12:00 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"5 Alternatives to Guinness and Jameson For St. Patrick's Day","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5746999287001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5746999287001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2oWXOf6\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dguinness%2Cstaptricksdayguinness%2Cstpatricksday%2Cstpatricksdaybeer%2Cstpatricksdaymoney%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dstpatricksday&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"Looking for a bit o' the Irish?

The inevitable was announced Wednesday when the bankrupt company told employees it would most likely close all of its 700 or so remaining U.S. stores.<\/p>\n<p>The end of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us, which accounts for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/09\/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-why\/\">15% of U.S. toy revenue<\/a>, will have far-reaching effects on the industry. Here&#8217;s who and what will be impacted the most.<\/p>\n<h2>Employees<\/h2>\n<p>The U.S. division of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us employs some 33,000 people, all of whom will be affected by the closure. Stores will remain open for some time with liquidation sales set to begin in a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>And some employees might keep their jobs if Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us successfully sells its healthier Canadian business, plus its 200 best U.S. stores to a buyer, with the new entity run from Canada.<\/p>\n<h2>Mattel<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mattel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mattel<\/a>, the maker of Barbie, Fisher Price, and <em>Monster High<\/em> toys, have already been impacted by the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/26\/mattel-earnings-toys-r-us\/\">Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us bankruptcy<\/a>. The company has seen its global sales fall since the company filed for its bankruptcy. Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us is Mattel\u2019s second-largest customer, accounting for between 15 and 20% of the company\u2019s U.S. sales. And the retailer still owes Mattel more than $135 million.<\/p>\n<p>The closing of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us will now put even greater pressure on the company as it looks for places to sell its dolls and games.<\/p>\n<h2>Lego<\/h2>\n<p>The bankruptcy has pushed shares down on publicly traded companies like Hasbro and Mattel. But privately held companies have been impacted as well. The plastic bricks maker reported its <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/06\/investing\/lego-revenue-drop-star-wars\/index.html?iid=EL\">first sales drop in 13 years<\/a> earlier this week. Still, Lego is still better poised to handle the loss of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us than its toy maker competitors, in part due to its success with its <em>Lego Movie<\/em> and <em>Star Wars<\/em> line of toys.<\/p>\n<h2>JAKK<\/h2>\n<p>The company is a licensee of several hundred trademarks including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney<\/a>, <em>Star Wars<\/em>, and Nintendo. The company also makes kids furniture, construction and outdoor toys, dress-up and role play types of toys, as well as action figures.<\/p>\n<h2>Hasbro<\/h2>\n<p>The toymaker is behind such iconic brands such as My Little Pony, Play-Doh, board games like Monopoly, Yahtzee, Cranium, and Candy Land, as well as GI Joe action figures.<\/p>\n<p>Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink says toy makers Mattel and Hasbro will both be forced to deal with an industry-wide sales decline of between 2.5 and 5.5% in 2018 resulting from the closings, <a href=\"https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/investing\/stock-market-news\/articles\/2018-03-15\/mattel-inc-mat-stock\"><em>US News<\/em> reported<\/a>. Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us also owes <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1090919\/all-the-toys-and-makers-toys-r-us-owes-money-in-one-chart\/\">Hasbro about $59 million<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The Next Shopkins<\/h2>\n<p>Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us didn&#8217;t just support existing and large toymakers, it was often the company that helped new and emerging toymakers get their start.<\/p>\n<h2>Spinmaster<\/h2>\n<div class=\"g\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"rc\">\n<div class=\"s\">This is actually one company that could do well, according to an analyst note from Jefferies. The company&#8217;s growth has been driven by strong Hatchimal sales and its gaming segment.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"s\"><\/div>\n<div>SpinMaster isn&#8217;t dependent on toy retailers in the same way as Hasbro and Mattel have been. The company has diverse sales channels, selling their products at bookstores, specialty fashion, drug and grocery stores.

The invitation includes the caption, &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a field trip&#8221; and invites attendees to the Lane Tech College Prop High School on Chicago&#8217;s north side. Apple said that the event will focus on &#8220;new creative ideas for teachers and students.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rumors have been swirling that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/02\/24\/apple-airpower-ipad-march-event\/\">Apple was planning a March event<\/a>. However, those rumors suggested the company&#8217;s event would be held at its Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino. The rumors also said that Apple would unveil new iPads at the show and perhaps a new iPhone SE for budget-conscious shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>Although Apple has hinted that its March 27 show will focus on students, it might have broader appeal. New tablets, for instance, could benefit students and teachers as much as consumers. And considering the Apple invite featuring the company&#8217;s logo appears to have been drawn digitally with a stylus, it&#8217;s possible the tech giant could also unveil <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/13\/apple-iphone-apple-pencil\/\">a new version of its Apple Pencil stylus<\/a> for digitally writing on iPads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise Apple is focusing on the education sector.

The service would offer users access to games from a variety of developers, including Microsoft, and stream those titles to the player&#8217;s device of choice, according to the interview.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re looking at ways to make that content available to anyone no matter what device they\u2019re on,&#8221; Microsoft gaming cloud division chief Kareem Choudhry said in the interview. He told the tech news site that there will eventually be &#8220;2 billion gamers in the world&#8221; and Microsoft&#8217;s goal &#8220;is to reach every one of them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it could prove difficult. The <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/11\/15\/microsoft-xbox-one-x-guide\/\">video game industry has long been a siloed market<\/a> where games available on one console cannot be played elsewhere. Players, then, are forced to choose which console to play a game on. And those who want to play exclusive titles available only on specific hardware will need to buy each console to have access to any and all games.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The cloud, however, presents a new opportunity. By storing games in the cloud, developers could technically stream their content to PCs, mobile devices, and consoles. And Microsoft, which operates its Azure cloud service, among several others, believes it can deliver the platform on which games are delivered.<\/p>\n<p>Whether Nintendo and Sony will play ball, though, is unknown. Nintendo has only recently started delivering games to platforms beyond its own consoles, and in those cases, it&#8217;s only doing so on iPhones and Android devices. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have never expressed interest in bringing their exclusive games to other consoles.<\/p>\n<p>Still, a streaming game service could be successful without Nintendo and Sony&#8217;s help. The majority of games, after all, are developed by third-party developers. Adding Microsoft&#8217;s games to the lineup could ensure a relatively well-rounded lineup of titles.<\/p>\n<p>According to the report, Choudhry balked at providing a timeline for a possible game-streaming launch. But he did say that Microsoft is focused on the service and is &#8220;spending a lot of time thinking about that space.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16

writing a memoir to be published in September that will detail her complicated relationship with her father.<\/p>\n<p>The book, by Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 39, is to be titled <em>Small Fry<\/em>, from publisher Grove Press.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa Brennan-Jobs, whose mother is artist Chrisann Brennan, had little contact her father during her early years. Initially, Steve Jobs questioned his paternity, but later apologized and became more involved by inviting her into his world of &#8220;mansions, vacations, and private schools,&#8221; according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Small-Fry-Lisa-Brennan-Jobs\/dp\/0802128238\/\">description of the book on Amazon<\/a>, and also naming one of Apple&#8217;s early computers, the Apple Lisa, after her.<\/p>\n<p>The book promises to give new insight into Steve Jobs, who while a brilliant businessman and marketer, was also known for being mercurial with friends, family, and colleagues.<\/p>\n<p><em>Small Fry<\/em> will follow a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson\/dp\/1451648537\">biography of Steve Jobs<\/a> by Walter Isaacson in 2011 that covered Steve Jobs&#8217; relationship with Lisa Brennan-Jobs and her mother. Jobs later married Laurene Powell, with whom he had three children.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the full description on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> of the upcoming book by Lisa Brennan-Jobs:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Born on a farm and named in a field by her parents\u2015artist Chrisann Brennan and Steve Jobs\u2015Lisa Brennan-Jobs\u2019s childhood unfolded in a rapidly changing Silicon Valley. When she was young, Lisa\u2019s father was a mythical figure who was rarely present in her life. As she grew older, her father took an interest in her, ushering her into a new world of mansions, vacations, and private schools. His attention was thrilling, but he could also be cold, critical and unpredictable. When her relationship with her mother grew strained in high school, Lisa decided to move in with her father, hoping he\u2019d become the parent she\u2019d always wanted him to be.<\/p>\n<p><em>Small Fry<\/em> is Lisa Brennan-Jobs\u2019s poignant story of a childhood spent between two imperfect but extraordinary homes. Scrappy, wise, and funny, young Lisa is an unforgettable guide through her parents\u2019 fascinating and disparate worlds. Part portrait of a complex family, part love letter to California in the seventies and eighties, <em>Small Fry<\/em> is an enthralling book by an insightful new literary voice.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 03:08:05","updated":"2018-03-16 03:08:05","minute":"3:08 PM

Economist: Why the LinkedIn Data Case Is a Lose-Lose Situation","content":"<p>As an economic statistician who analyzes data for a living, I have been fascinated to observe the recent court case involving hiQ Labs and LinkedIn. My job depends quite crucially on access to interesting databases, and LinkedIn has a remarkable one.<\/p>\n<p>In August 2017, LinkedIn blocked hiQ from accessing its data available in public LinkedIn profiles of registered users, which hiQ had been using to build algorithms. HiQ took LinkedIn to court, and the case is currently mired in the appeals process after a U.S. district court judge in the Northern District of California granted a preliminary injunction against LinkedIn. LinkedIn\u2019s attorneys subsequently filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard in San Francisco on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>The case hinges on questions of who owns a piece of data and the circumstances under which the information can be viewed as residing in the public domain, accessible by all and sundry. The appeals court judges may rule that LinkedIn owns exclusive rights to the data, which would not have been compiled without the entrepreneurial talents of LinkedIn\u2019s founders. Conversely, the judges may conclude that since LinkedIn users set their profiles to \u201cpublic,\u201d placing them in full view of search engines and general web surfers, they are giving companies like hiQ free rein to view and use the data as they see fit.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a knife-edge decision with strong arguments on both sides. Either ruling could have profound implications for how people like you and me interact with data in our daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>If the case goes against LinkedIn, the company will likely have two potential responses: Keep the data public and actively compete in the analytics space, or make the data accessible only by those signed into the service, as the act of signing in would, in theory, limit broader public access to the data. The second of these is perhaps the most interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Most LinkedIn users leverage the site to boost their profiles and careers by looking up and connecting with new business acquaintances or search for job opportunities. Personally, I never surf incognito and will normally invite the people I look up to connect. For LinkedIn, which was founded to enable these searches, such a change may be existential. If its data were made private so that LinkedIn profiles would not be searchable by search engines, the utility most users get from the service\u2014to be \u201cfound\u201d\u2014would undoubtedly be disrupted and the network would hold much less appeal.<\/p>\n<p>One can easily imagine rival startups, willing to live with open access to any data they collect, springing up to fill the void. Anyone who remembers MySpace, formerly the dominant player in social networking, will know that large networks can be usurped by upstarts with a more compelling value proposition for users. People like the ability to control the public nature of their LinkedIn profile and can be counted on to migrate in large numbers if the feature is ever withdrawn.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn will then hold exclusive rights to a database of rapidly diminishing value.<\/p>\n<p>If, on the contrary, LinkedIn prevails in the case, the implications will be monumental. One major positive outcome from such a result will be that social network entrepreneurs will be emboldened to start new and better websites and apps. The industry is only 15 years old, so considerable innovation is still possible. Holding exclusive data rights to a network can be viewed as akin to a patent on a new invention. Society bestows these rights to allow inventors to recoup the investments they made and to reward them for the risks they took to get their ideas into the marketplace. The prospect of holding monopoly-pricing power then encourages other individuals and organizations to expend energy to develop their own ideas. The same may well be true for social networks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInventing\u201d a new database is, generally, very hard. Those who come up with clever ways of extracting information, like building a social network, or who expend the laborious effort to collect data from primary sources, should be able to profit handsomely from their exertions. If such data were made public through judicial decree, free riders would abound and private enterprise would have no incentive to collect data in the future.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5460335429001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5460335429001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2FUU1d0\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddataprivacy%2Cphonedata%2Cscotus%2Csupremecourt%2Csupremecourtcase%2Ctrackingphonedata%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dsupremecourt&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, with LinkedIn in full control of the compiled information, society would suffer in other ways. The world is being flooded with data, and analysts around the world are grappling with ways to link disparate databases across cyberspace. One can posit that profound insights that could enhance social welfare lie at the intersections of these databases. Perhaps LinkedIn data could be tied to health statistics to yield a cure for cancer? This is a stretch, of course, though we can\u2019t definitively rule it out until research is undertaken. Along the way, companies may identify less profound, but nonetheless useful, insights that allow them to profit by making life slightly better for their clients. These innovations would be greatly diminished if competitive pressures were removed.<\/p>\n<p>So we, through our legislators and judges, face an especially cruel choice in cases like this. We can make our data freely available and have no one bother to collect it. Or, we can bestow ownership rights on the data and potentially miss out on beneficial insights gleaned from its analysis.<\/p>\n<p>As a statistician, I hope that large databases continue to be collected so we can explore how this data can be used not only for private but also public benefit.<\/p>\n<div id=\"article-body\" class=\"article content body clearfix\">\n<div class=\"padded\">\n<p><em>Tony Hughes is m<\/em><em>anaging director at <\/em><em>Moody\u2019s Analytics.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 11:37:32","updated":"2018-03-16 11:37:32","minute":"11:37 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/linkedin-hiq-labs-data-case\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/linkedin-hiq-labs-data-case\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/linkedin-hiq-labs-data-case\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Moody\u2019s Analytics Economist: Why the LinkedIn Data Case Is a Lose-Lose Situation","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-864512464.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"S3studio\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Young man is using the LinkedIn Corp. app that is displayed on an Apple Inc. iPad the biggest online professional-networking service on October 20, 2017 in Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

Oliver Criticized Him on 'Last Week Tonight'","content":"<p>Following a segment by <em>Last Week Tonight<\/em> host John Oliver that alluded to past lawsuits against major cryptocurrency player Brock Pierce, the startup that he co-founded to rival Ethereum now says it has parted ways with the controversial former child star.<\/p>\n<p>Block.one, the firm developing blockchain platform EOS, wrote on <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/eosio\/dear-john-oliver-6aa5ac5fff26\">Medium<\/a> on Tuesday that Pierce would step down from his role as chief strategy officer. &#8220;We recently came to a mutual agreement that Brock would end his role at <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/block.one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">block.one<\/a> as he transitions to independent community building and investment activities,&#8221; the company said without giving a reason for his departure.<\/p>\n<p>Although still <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/18\/investors-are-lining-up-to-buy-this-cryptocurrency-with-no-purpose\/\">under development<\/a>, EOS has become one of the most talked-about blockchain services in the crypto-sphere. Since being announced in May, investors excited by the potentially more flexible, and faster blockchain network upon which <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/02\/08\/blockchain-everipedia\/\">new applications can be built<\/a>, helped block.one raise $700 million initially, with the value of all EOS in circulation now at $3.8 billion\u2014making it the ninth largest cryptocurrency\u2014according to <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/all\/views\/all\/\">CoinMarketCap.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, Oliver raised questions about EOS&#8217;s status and alluded to Pierce having an unsavory history. After broadcasting a corporate marketing video showing Pierce talking about the potential benefits of EOS, Oliver called Pierce a &#8220;douche&#8221; and criticized his prior acting career.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That sleepy creepy cowboy from the future is named Brock Pierce. He began his career appearing in &#8216; <em>The Mighty Ducks<\/em>&#8216; and in&#8230; a Gushers commercial as a child who turns into a banana,&#8221; Oliver said. &#8220;Well that banana then got involved with some very unsavory figures.

Those lawsuits stemming from 2000 alleged that the cryptocurrency co-founder had pressured them as then-minors for sex.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, several members of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for the cryptocurrency, resigned in protest of Pierce&#8217;s election as a director of the organization.<\/p>\n<p>Pierce denied the sexual abuse allegations, telling Reuters that two of the suits were dropped. He did however, pay over $21,000 to settle another, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-bitcoin-foundation-resignations\/bitcoin-foundation-hit-by-resignations-over-new-director-idUSBREA4F02B20140516\">Reuters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Neither Pierce nor block.one responded to immediate requests by <em>Fortune<\/em> for comment.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, Pierce appeared to be amused by Oliver&#8217;s criticisms, tweeting out a link to the comedian&#8217;s YouTube video of the segment and suggesting that his followers should watch it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Oliver mentions our wedding.

Affected","content":"<p>When news broke that Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us had failed to find a buyer or reach a debt restructuring deal with lenders, the end seemed near for the the 70-year-old big box toy retailer. The inevitable was announced Wednesday when the bankrupt company told employees it would most likely close all of its 700 or so remaining U.S. stores.<\/p>\n<p>The end of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us, which accounts for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/09\/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-why\/\">15% of U.S. toy revenue<\/a>, will have far-reaching effects on the industry. Here&#8217;s who and what will be impacted the most.<\/p>\n<h2>Employees<\/h2>\n<p>The U.S. division of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us employs some 33,000 people, all of whom will be affected by the closure. Stores will remain open for some time with liquidation sales set to begin in a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>And some employees might keep their jobs if Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us successfully sells its healthier Canadian business, plus its 200 best U.S. stores to a buyer, with the new entity run from Canada.<\/p>\n<h2>Mattel<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mattel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mattel<\/a>, the maker of Barbie, Fisher Price, and <em>Monster High<\/em> toys, have already been impacted by the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/26\/mattel-earnings-toys-r-us\/\">Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us bankruptcy<\/a>. The company has seen its global sales fall since the company filed for its bankruptcy. Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us is Mattel\u2019s second-largest customer, accounting for between 15 and 20% of the company\u2019s U.S. sales. And the retailer still owes Mattel more than $135 million.<\/p>\n<p>The closing of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us will now put even greater pressure on the company as it looks for places to sell its dolls and games.<\/p>\n<h2>Lego<\/h2>\n<p>The bankruptcy has pushed shares down on publicly traded companies like Hasbro and Mattel. But privately held companies have been impacted as well. The plastic bricks maker reported its <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/06\/investing\/lego-revenue-drop-star-wars\/index.html?iid=EL\">first sales drop in 13 years<\/a> earlier this week. Still, Lego is still better poised to handle the loss of Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us than its toy maker competitors, in part due to its success with its <em>Lego Movie<\/em> and <em>Star Wars<\/em> line of toys.<\/p>\n<h2>JAKK<\/h2>\n<p>The company is a licensee of several hundred trademarks including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney<\/a>, <em>Star Wars<\/em>, and Nintendo.

in years past, chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is offering $1 million every year for life to any of his employees who can pick a perfect NCAA tournament bracket through the Sweet 16. This year, the March Madness stakes are even better: Buffett said he&#8217;ll <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/11\/news\/companies\/selection-sunday-bracket-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway\/index.html\">double the prize<\/a> if a team from his home state of Nebraska takes the title.<\/p>\n<p>For Buffett, it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet. Of the 18.8 million brackets filled out on ESPN last year, only 18 got the Sweet 16 right. In the four years Buffett has run similar contests, no one has taken home the grand prize.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened in the previous contests:<\/p>\n<h2>2014<\/h2>\n<p>The first year the prize was offered, the contest was open to the public and sponsored by Berkshire Hathaway and Quicken Loans. The prize that year was $1 billion for a perfect bracket, which no one won. A lawsuit later revealed that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/yahoo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo<\/a> had backed out of a contract to offer a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/21\/yahoo-ncaa-tournament-bracket-deal\/\">similar contest<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>2015<\/h2>\n<p>The legal issues that followed the initial 2014 contest meant the contest didn&#8217;t happen that year, much to the disappointment of fans who had taken Buffet at his word that he wanted the contest to be <a href=\"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2397074-warren-buffetts-1-billion-bracket-challenge-dropped-for-2015-ncaa-tournament\">easier to win<\/a> in 2015.<\/p>\n<h2>2016<\/h2>\n<p>In 2016, Buffett brought the contest back, but just for the more than 300,000 people who work for Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries. Buffett offered $1 million every year for life rather than a one-time payment of $1 billion to anyone who picked a perfect Sweet 16, or $100,000 to the longest surviving bracket. Two Berkshire employees, Kevin Wills of insurance company USLI and Robert Keller of Berkshire-owned Geico, <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/meet-the-big-prize-winners-of-warren-buffett-berkshire-march-madness-pool-221820079.html\">split<\/a> the $100,000, having each correctly predicted the first 15 games of the tournament.<\/p>\n<h2>2017<\/h2>\n<p>Last year, the offer was the same: $1 million every year for life for a perfect bracket, or $100,000 for the best bracket. A West Virginia steel worker named Dwayne Johnson came tantalizingly close to winning the grand prize, correctly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/business\/wp\/2017\/03\/23\/buffett-bracket\/?utm_term=.50fb22d193dd\">predicting<\/a> 31 out of the first 32 games. He won the $100,000 prize for having the bracket that stayed intact the longest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 12, 2018","published":"2018-03-12 06:26:58","updated":"2018-03-12

Patrick's Day","content":"<p>Walk into your local liquor store and you could be forgiven for thinking St. Patrick&#8217;s Day was created by Guinness. It&#8217;s the day for Ireland&#8217;s favorite beer to shine\u2014and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/09\/guinness-st-patricks-day-pints\/\">13 million pints<\/a> of the stout will be consumed in those 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Guinness, of course. (It&#8217;s delicious!) Nor is there anything wrong with Jameson, Ireland&#8217;s best known whisky. But if you want to have a St. Paddy&#8217;s Day celebration that stands out from the crowd, there are a few other options available to you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few you might not have been aware of.<\/p>\n<p><strong>O\u2019Hara\u2019s Irish Stout: <\/strong>Made by one of Ireland&#8217;s first craft brewers, this is an incredibly smooth, easy-drinking stout. It&#8217;s full-bodied and boasts a flavor profile that leans most heavily on the roasted, smoky flavors of the malt. You&#8217;ll pick up the slight hint of espresso, but not enough that it&#8217;s distracting. It has a crisp, dry finish that will leave you eager for more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Murphy&#8217;s Irish Red: <\/strong>Currently owned by Heinekin, Murphy&#8217;s is increasing the size of its footprint through the U.S. with many strong offerings. The Irish Red is a good choice for St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, with a dry, crisp, hoppy taste and plenty of carbonation. It&#8217;s a good choice for those who want to celebrate, but aren&#8217;t fans of stouts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kinnegar Brewing Scraggy Bay: <\/strong>This IPA&#8217;s going to be difficult to find, but if you get your hands on it, guard it jealously. Kennegar is a fairly young craft brewer based out of County Donegal that specializes in farmhouse ales. Their saisons are well done, but Scraggy Bay, a hoppy golden ale, is their most popular, offering citrus and floral notes all riding atop of slight bitterness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Knappogue Castle 12 Year: <\/strong>Prefer Irish whisky to beer? A boutique distillery with U.S. distribution, Knappogue&#8217;s signature single malt spends 12 years in bourbon barrels. It&#8217;s crisp with hints of both fruit and pepper and is good both neat and on the rocks. It&#8217;s a wonderful find for the discerning whisky enthusiast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bushmills Red Bush Irish Whiskey: <\/strong>Sometimes, you&#8217;re looking for a good whisky on a budget. Red Bush offers a quality taste for just $20 to $25 per bottle. The bourbon barrel profile is harder to pick out, but you&#8217;ll get a nice biscuity body with tropical fruit notes. There&#8217;s a spice to this one that might take some people off guard, but it&#8217;s a good blend that&#8217;s fine on its own or even better in cocktails.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 12:00:26","updated":"2018-03-16 12:00:26","minute":"12:00 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/guinness-jameson-st-patricks-day-2018-beer-whisky\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"5 Alternatives to Guinness and Jameson For St. Patrick's Day ","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"22\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5746999287001-22\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5746999287001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2oWXOf6\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dguinness%2Cstaptricksdayguinness%2Cstpatricksday%2Cstpatricksdaybeer%2Cstpatricksdaymoney%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dstpatricksday&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Looking for a bit o&#8217; the Irish?

Inside the Last Days of Toys 'R' Us","content":"<div class=\"article\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>You want a trip to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, head office of Geoffrey the Giraffe, to feel like a visit to a sugarplum Toyland.<\/p>\n<p>But the mood is black these days inside One Geoffrey Way in Wayne, New Jersey, spiritual home of the cartoon mascot who\u2019s been beckoning to kids for generations.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Dave Brandon, chief executive officer of the iconic toy chain, delivered the news that his more than 30,000 U.S. workers had been dreading: We\u2019re finished. After 70 years, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us would close shop &#8212; a casualty of Amazon-era retailing and debt-fueled, private-equity deal-making.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am devastated that we have reached this point,\u201d Brandon told a group of about 600 employees. \u201cI truly believe we did our best, under what turned out to be nearly impossible circumstances.\u201d He choked up as he spoke.<\/p>\n<p>How did it come to this? The answer, as with most bankruptcies, is slowly, and then all at once. In the pre-Internet dark age, the company was the unrivaled supermarket of toys, the arbiter of fads and tastes that shaped the entire industry. Its advertising jingle &#8212; \u201cI don\u2019t want to grow up, I\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us kid\u201d &#8212; is lodged in the brains of millions.<\/p>\n<p>Read more: Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Stokes Nostalgia by Breaking Into Song in Chapter 11<\/p>\n<p>But by last September, just months before the crucial holiday season, relentless competition from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>.com Inc. and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a> Inc. &#8212; combined with more than $5 billion in debt from a 2005 leveraged buyout &#8212; had finally overwhelmed the chain. With little warning, it filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, in the hope, Brandon said at the time, of emerging better than ever.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dawn of a new day for the company,\u201d he proclaimed at the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in New York\u2019s Times Square.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, his hopeful plans unraveled at a startling clip. Battles quickly broke out between management and long-time creditors, who were owed about $5 billion at the time of the filing. Lenders soon were urging Brandon to shut hundreds of the 800 U.S. stores fast to contain the damage. Before long, vendors were growing wary about shipping toys to the chain, fearing they might not get paid.<\/p>\n<h3>Abandoned Hopes<\/h3>\n<p>The financial powers behind Toys \u201cR\u201d Us &#8212; among them KKR &amp; Co., Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust &#8212; had all but given up by then. After earning more than $470 million in fees and interest payments while taking no dividends, according to regulatory filings, they\u2019d abandoned hopes of flipping Toys \u201cR\u201d Us back onto the stock market in 2013 for the ultimate payoff. The only thing to do, it seemed, was to keep cutting costs and, hopefully, negotiate easier terms on all that debt.<\/p>\n<p>On one level, the announced liquidation (at least in the U.S.) is yet another familiar story about the sorry state of old-school retailing. On another, it\u2019s a tale of how private equity has, in many cases, worsened the industry\u2019s upheavals. Sports Authority, Gymboree, Payless Shoesource, Claire\u2019s, J. Crew: All these chains, and more, have struggled to adapt to the fast-changing landscape after being taken private.<\/p>\n<p>With Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Chapter 11, the company declined to comment. Representatives of the owners also declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.<\/p>\n<h3>Falling Values<\/h3>\n<p>Bondholders have seen the value of their investment plummet. The company\u2019s senior unsecured bonds due in 2018 last traded Thursday at 5.25 cents on the dollar, down from 72 cents the week before the bankruptcy filing, according to Trace bond-price data.<\/p>\n<p>Almost from the start, sharp lines were drawn, according to people involved in the bankruptcy process. After the September filing, creditors &#8212; including holders of some $3 billion in bankruptcy financing &#8212; complained that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was being less than forthcoming about its financials, as well as its turnaround strategy. Six months after the filing, the company had no bankruptcy-exit plan in place, and lenders were losing faith.<\/p>\n<p>The lenders, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/jpmorgan-chase\/\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase<\/a> &amp; Co. and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs Group<\/a> Inc., jockeyed to provide debtor-in-possession loans, which are first in line to get repaid. Then a group of hedge funds threatened in October to trigger a default on these loans until they got a $30 million piece of them. Others argued over the valuations of various international subsidiaries and assets, such as intellectual property and the growing Asian business.<\/p>\n<h3>Crucial Season<\/h3>\n<p>Then came Black Friday, the crucial kickoff to the U.S. holiday shopping season. The Christmas run-up turned into a disaster for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Brandon later complained that the September bankruptcy had shaken customers\u2019 confidence. But there were other problems: The slow pace of negotiations was unnerving vendors and prompting creditors to urge more store closings.<\/p>\n<p>Amid the disputes, suppliers grew increasingly anxious. Would Toys \u201cR\u201d Us really emerge from bankruptcy? Firms that insure vendor shipments and provide short-term financing began to back away. As of early February, most had bolted.<\/p>\n<p>By then, vendors had learned what Brandon already knew: The holiday season had delivered a blow, with sales plunging about 15 percent from the previous year.<\/p>\n<p>Brandon\u2019s initial optimism was fading. In a Jan. 23 letter to employees, he blamed the holiday showing on the bankruptcy, as well as some operational missteps. Formerly athletic director at the University of Michigan (he resigned amid disapproval from the Board of Regents and student anger over his profit-driven approach to the job), he\u2019d had a successful stint at Domino\u2019s Pizza and was recruited by Bain in 2015. Now, he desperately needed another win.<\/p>\n<h3>Hands-Off Approach<\/h3>\n<p>But beyond picking executives, the private-equity owners generally took a hands-off approach, people familiar with the matter say. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, meantime, was left to pay more than $400 million a year in interest alone on its debts.<\/p>\n<p>By February, some senior-most lenders began to push for an outright liquidation. And, with that, 70 years of retail history slid toward an ignominious end.<\/p>\n<p>Prospects could be buoyed by a group of toymakers who said Wednesday they\u2019re looking to make a bid for the company\u2019s Canadian business, through which they would buy some U.S. locations in the liquidation to operate as a subsidiary. Other potential liquidation bidders have begun to crop up as well.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, at the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Express on 33rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, Angela Milligan, 28, and Chace Douglas, 25, were looking for bankruptcy bargains (no liquidation markdowns yet). Other customers waxed nostalgic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe grew up with it,\u201d said John Park, 39. \u201cMy kids aren\u2019t going to experience a place where there\u2019s just shelves of toys.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"attachments\"><\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 11:38:25","updated":"2018-03-16 11:38:25","minute":"11:38 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/inside-toys-r-us-closure\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/inside-toys-r-us-closure\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/inside-toys-r-us-closure\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"23\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5751488157001-23\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5751488157001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2IvDiLQ\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dchapter11%2Cretail%2Ctoysrus%2Ctoysrusbankruptcy%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dtoysrus&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>The mood is black these days inside One Geoffrey Way.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2107029","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/bloomberg\/","name":"Bloomberg","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":447824487,"name":"Retail","slug":"retail","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46735,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and updates on the retail sector, including companies like Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Sears, Home Depot, and other places to shop.","parent":0,"count":10099,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Retail","slug":"retail","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/retail\/","newsletter_info":"The Fortune CEO Daily"},"tags":[{"term_id":295139,"name":"Bloomberg","slug":"bloomberg","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110701,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":889,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":447811327,"name":"OneTime","slug":"onetime","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":178270,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":8453,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":475475,"name":"Toys R Us","slug":"toys-r-us","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110579,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":70,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":false,"primary_tag":{"name":"Toys R Us","slug":"toys-r-us","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/toys-r-us\/"},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"The mood is black these days inside One Geoffrey Way.","seo":{"seo_title":"Inside the Last Days of Toys 'R' Us","seo_description":"Dave Brandon, CEO of the iconic toy chain, delivered the news that his more than 30,000 U.S. workers had been dreading","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/inside-toys-r-us-closure\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2018%2F03%2F16%2Finside-toys-r-us-closure%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/2IvDiLQ","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F2IvDiLQ","encoded_title":"Who+Killed+Geoffrey+the+Giraffe%3F+Inside+the+Last+Days+of+Toys+%E2%80%98R%E2%80%99+Us","twitter_text":"Who killed Geoffrey the Giraffe?

The Los Angeles-based company didn\u2019t immediately have further comment on Rihanna\u2019s criticism.

These 50 Latina executives are running <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Fortune<\/em> 500 companies<\/a>, large private firms, and a few are entrepreneurs leading global companies.

The first is the cost of the computers themselves\u2014as the mathematical problems get progressively harder over time, miners need to keep upgrading their rigs. The second issue is energy. Making loads of incorrect guesses uses a lot of it. And then there&#8217;s cooling; all that energy use throws off a lot of heat. (Bitcoin is, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/15\/bitcoin-dirty-secret-energy-use-pollution\/\">terrible for the environment<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us back to Bitcoin&#8217;s profitability. This wasn&#8217;t a problem when the cryptocurrency was heading &#8220;to the Moon,&#8221; as enthusiasts were fond of putting it, but since late last year, Bitcoin has largely been heading in the other direction. Having <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/17\/bitcoin-record-high-short-of-20000\/\">gone to near $20,000<\/a> in mid-December, it&#8217;s currently worth little more than $8,200.<\/p>\n<p>According to Fundstrat, the current break-even point for Bitcoin mining is $8,038.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Miners contend with Bitcoin transaction fees<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/03\/15\/bad-news-for-bitcoin-miners-as-its-no-longer-profitable-to-create-the-cryptocurrency.html\">CNBC noted<\/a>, miners not only have to deal with increasing competition and a falling Bitcoin price\u2014they&#8217;re also being stung by another part of their revenue, transaction fees. While Bitcoin adherents cite low fees as an advantage of the cryptocurrency over traditional finance networks, the median fee for a transaction reached $34 in late December. Now it&#8217;s down below 50 cents.<\/p>\n<p>So is everyone going to give up and stop mining Bitcoin now? Not likely. Its profitability depends greatly on energy costs and, while Fundstrat&#8217;s model uses a global average of 6 cents per kilowatt hour, Chinese miners apparently only have to pay 4 cents or less.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not the activity still makes sense <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/07\/bitcoin-mining-costs-global-south-korea-venezuela\/\">really depends on where you are<\/a>.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 08:51:57","updated":"2018-03-16 08:51:57","minute":"8:51 AM

Rather, that&#8217;s nearly $500 billion lost based on when those 1,565 cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap collectively reached their all-time high in valuation.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part however, the smaller, so-called alt-currencies have largely followed the up-and-downs of Bitcoin\u2014a trend that the most recent sell-off has maintained.<\/p>\n<p>And as far as one Bitcoin bull is concerned, the slide may have further to go before its comeback.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When sentiment is this weak, the market is increasingly &#8216;fire, ready, aim&#8217;\u2014meaning, any headline today is likely to trigger selling,&#8221; wrote Thomas Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner, in a note early Thursday. That comes as the price of Bitcoin <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/bitcoin-price-plummet-stops-8000\/\">reaches about $8,000,<\/a> down 7% in the last 24 hours. Similary, the price of Ethereum dropped 9% below $600, while Ripple fell to 68 cents, falling about 8% during the same period.<\/p>\n<p>How much further might Bitcoin&#8217;s value fall, according to Fundstrat? Based on back of the envelope calculations and estimates from Fundstrat, Bitcoin valuation could shed another $37 billion in the near future, falling to about $99 billion in market capitalization.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s based on technical analysis (an investing strategy <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/21\/bitcoin-price-chart\/\">with both its pros and cons<\/a>) from Fundstrat technical strategist Robert Sluymer, who wrote in that same note: &#8220;Our expectation is Bitcoin will begin to show evidence of bottoming short-term closer to $5,873.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After which, presumably, investors would once again buy in, allowing the cryptocurrency to bounce.<\/p>\n<p>But not all are so bullish about the asset. As it stands now, Bitcoin is not backed by any asset or institution. It still lacks widespread acceptance as a currency, and appears to trade largely on sentiment. As Allianz Global Investors wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allianzgi.com\/en\/home\/insights\/investment-themes-and-strategy\/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble\">in a recent blog post<\/a>\u2014Bitcoin is risky. That&#8217;s not to say investors can&#8217;t gain from it in the short term. Speculation and hype may continue to lift the price of the asset. But trying to time that market, one Allianz thinks as a bubble waiting to pop, is no easy task.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In our view, its intrinsic value must be zero: a Bitcoin is a claim on nobody\u2014in contrast to, for instance, sovereign bonds, equities, or paper money\u2014and it does not generate any income stream,&#8221; Stefan Hofrichter, head of global economics and strategy, wrote in the note. &#8220;So is this the end of the hype about Bitcoin as the future of global currencies? Probably not yet, since speculation in Bitcoin and similar instruments appears set to continue for some time.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 15, 2018","published":"2018-03-15

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a> has a plan for getting 2 billion gamers around the world to use its service.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/15\/17123452\/microsoft-gaming-cloud-xbox-future\">interview<\/a> with The Verge, a Microsoft Xbox team member said that the company is working on a service that would function in much the same way as a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/01\/22\/netflix-earnings-subscriber-growth-100-billion\/\">Netflix for video games<\/a>. The service would offer users access to games from a variety of developers, including Microsoft, and stream those titles to the player&#8217;s device of choice, according to the interview.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re looking at ways to make that content available to anyone no matter what device they\u2019re on,&#8221; Microsoft gaming cloud division chief Kareem Choudhry said in the interview. He told the tech news site that there will eventually be &#8220;2 billion gamers in the world&#8221; and Microsoft&#8217;s goal &#8220;is to reach every one of them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it could prove difficult. The <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/11\/15\/microsoft-xbox-one-x-guide\/\">video game industry has long been a siloed market<\/a> where games available on one console cannot be played elsewhere. Players, then, are forced to choose which console to play a game on. And those who want to play exclusive titles available only on specific hardware will need to buy each console to have access to any and all games.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The cloud, however, presents a new opportunity. By storing games in the cloud, developers could technically stream their content to PCs, mobile devices, and consoles. And Microsoft, which operates its Azure cloud service, among several others, believes it can deliver the platform on which games are delivered.<\/p>\n<p>Whether Nintendo and Sony will play ball, though, is unknown. Nintendo has only recently started delivering games to platforms beyond its own consoles, and in those cases, it&#8217;s only doing so on iPhones and Android devices. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have never expressed interest in bringing their exclusive games to other consoles.<\/p>\n<p>Still, a streaming game service could be successful without Nintendo and Sony&#8217;s help. The majority of games, after all, are developed by third-party developers. Adding Microsoft&#8217;s games to the lineup could ensure a relatively well-rounded lineup of titles.<\/p>\n<p>According to the report, Choudhry balked at providing a timeline for a possible game-streaming launch. But he did say that Microsoft is focused on the service and is &#8220;spending a lot of time thinking about that space.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16

Trump Voters Supported a 'Backwards' Agenda","content":"<p>The 2016 election was almost two years ago. But while Donald Trump came out on top in the election, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/01\/29\/nikki-haley-criticizes-hillary-clinton-grammys-cameo\/\">Hillary Clinton can still draw ire from conservative groups<\/a> and pundits\u2014as when she recently criticized those who voted for Trump as supporting a backward-looking ideology.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at 2018&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/12\/india-airbus-grounded-faulty-engine\/\">India<\/a> Today Conclave in Mumbai over the past weekend, Clinton said that voters who turned out for President Trump were following a campaign that was &#8220;looking backwards,&#8221; while those who supported her were fueled by optimism for America&#8217;s future.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the map of the United States, there is all that red in the middle, places where Trump won,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What that map doesn&#8217;t show you is that I won the places that won two thirds of America&#8217;s Gross Domestic product. I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, Make America Great Again, was looking backwards. You don&#8217;t like black people getting rights, you don&#8217;t like women getting jobs, you don&#8217;t want to see that Indian American succeeding more than you are, whatever that problem is, I am going to solve it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Clinton added that America doesn&#8217;t deserve a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/13\/rex-tillerson-fired-mike-pompeo-secretary-of-state\/\">Trump presidency<\/a>, and highlighted the people and businesses in the country that were standing up for their ideals. &#8220;Where governments lag like our own, business leaders and activists have stepped up to take action,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton also noted \u2014 as she has before \u2014 that the forces of Russian interference that led Trump to the Presidency are still at work around the globe, something that she said &#8220;represents a clear and present danger to democracy everywhere.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But it was her comments about Trump voters that drew the ire of conservatives and ricocheted across social media. Fox &amp; Friends slammed her for &#8220;trash[ing] America&#8217;s heartland,&#8221; and the research arm of the Republican National Committee wrote on Twitter, &#8220;Bitter Hillary Clinton trashes America\u2019s Heartland, calls states that didn\u2019t vote for her &#8216;backwards.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hillary Clinton trashes America\u2019s heartland, implying Trump\u2019s supporters are \u201cbackwards\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/E2yvsa8lRV\">pic.twitter.com\/E2yvsa8lRV<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; FOX &amp; friends (@foxandfriends) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxandfriends\/status\/973515515237986308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bitter Hillary Clinton trashes America\u2019s Heartland, calls states that didn\u2019t vote for her \u201cbackwards\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/domiT7Puqe\">https:\/\/t.co\/domiT7Puqe<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/zhMEGN29p5\">pic.twitter.com\/zhMEGN29p5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RNCResearch\/status\/973297664090570754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 13, 2018","published":"2018-03-13 09:21:12","updated":"2018-03-13 09:21:12","minute":"9:21 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/13\/hillary-clinton-criticized-after-saying-trump-voters-supported-a-backwards-agenda\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/13\/hillary-clinton-criticized-after-saying-trump-voters-supported-a-backwards-agenda\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/13\/hillary-clinton-criticized-after-saying-trump-voters-supported-a-backwards-agenda\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Conservatives Slam Hillary Clinton for Comments on Trump Voters","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"31\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5721555935001-31\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5721555935001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2pa5LOU\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcardib%2Centertainment%2Cfireandfury%2Cgrammys%2Chillaryclinton%2Cmichaelwolff%2Cpoliticalnews%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dgrammys&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>&#8220;I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward.&#8221;<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2065417","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/alana-abramson\/","name":"Alana Abramson","twitter":"aabramson","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"Alana Abramson is a news reporter at <em>Fortune<\/em> with a focus on politics.

None of the brands came out entirely unscathed.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the bottled water manufacturers cited in the study\u2014Nestle and Gerolsteiner\u2014disputed Orb Media&#8217;s results, saying they found much lower quantities of microplastics in their water. A bottle of Nestle Pure Life water showed the highest levels in Orb Media&#8217;s study, with 10,390 particles per liter.<\/p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t think the problem only applies to plastic bottles. &#8220;The study mostly focused on plastic bottles, but one batch of glass ones were checked for comparison. It turns out that the glass ones have microplastics too,&#8221; Andrew Mayes, the University of East Anglia biochemistry lecturer who developed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep44501\">the particle-spotting technique used in this research<\/a>, told <em>Fortune<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Is this a problem? No one&#8217;s really sure, because there isn&#8217;t enough data on the health effects of ingesting plastic. So, partly in response to Orb Media&#8217;s research, the World Health Organization has now <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-43389031\">told the BBC<\/a> it is launching its own review into the potential risks.<\/p>\n<p>Most microplastics are thought to pass through our systems, although very small particles (such as those found in the surveyed bottled water) may be absorbed into our organs, such as the liver and kidneys. That&#8217;s one concern; the other is that the particles, even those we excrete, might give off toxins as they pass through us.<\/p>\n<p>What is undeniable is that, for many people who lack access to safe drinking water from taps, bottled water remains a necessity.<\/p>\n<p>Orb Media was also behind a study last year that showed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2017\/sep\/06\/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals\">tap water around the world<\/a> is contaminated with microplastics. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efsa.europa.eu\/en\/press\/news\/160623\">particles have also been found<\/a> in beer, honey, table salt, and of course seafood, as our oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic waste.<\/p>\n<p>Some countries, particularly in Europe, have recently started taking the plastic waste threat seriously. The EU has a target of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/01\/17\/eu-pushes-plastic-recycling\/\">making all plastics recyclable<\/a> by 2030, while the U.K. has adopted a slightly less urgent target of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/01\/10\/theresa-may-avoidable-plastic-waste\/\">eliminating all avoidable plastic waste<\/a> within the next 25 years.<\/p>\n<p>As noted in Orb Media&#8217;s piece, EU rules ban contaminants in bottled water, although they don&#8217;t specifically regulate microplastic content. The U.S. also lacks specific laws on microplastics in food and drinks.<\/p>\n<p>Mayes said he suspects that &#8220;much of this plastic comes from the packaging process,&#8221; though he said there was no clear evidence so far for this. &#8220;Microplastics in the original water source cannot be ruled out, but seem unlikely in most cases because the water is either pumped up from aquifers (where it has been filtered through ground and rock, over many years) or it is exhaustively filtered and purified as part of the production process. It is hard to see how microplastics would sneak through that process, unless filters or beds are damaged in some way,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>He added that this aspect of the contamination was &#8220;ripe for investigation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola<\/a>, whose Dasani water brand was one of those tested, said in a statement: &#8220;We have some of the most stringent quality standards in the industry, and the water we use in our drinks is subject to multi-step filtration processes prior to production. As Orb Media\u2019s own reporting has shown, microscopic plastic fibers appear to be ubiquitous, and therefore may be found at minute levels even in highly treated products. We stand by the safety of our products, and welcome continued study of plastics in our environment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>This article was updated to include the quotes from Andrew Mayes and

predicament\u2014so much work, so little time\u2014I have felt my personal productivity flagging of late. Industrywide numbers bear out the sorry fact that, in this regard, I am part of a trend: Productivity has plateaued. As a workforce, we wheezed over the invisible finish line of 2015. Sure, there is consternation as to the reasons for this functional droop, but in truth, what does it matter? There are no excuses. There is just a huge opportunity to do things with more energy, style, and efficiency.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">First, I\u2019m going to get up earlier in order to lengthen the hours in which I provide value to the company. Right now I usually bolt upright at 6:02 each morning. Obviously, I\u2019m going to have to get the party started sooner. <em>Note to self<\/em>: Set alarm for 4:30. Want to join me?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Next, my Fitbit and I like to take a walk right after waking, because I don\u2019t want to die anytime soon, which would be the antithesis of productivity, I think. During this hour, which will now take place in the stone dark (see above), I have yet to achieve anything productive. So from now on I promise to be one of those people who plod around with a headset on, jabbering to somebody. <em>Note to self:<\/em> Find co-workers who either like working at 4:30 a.m. or reside in Bengaluru.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">No matter how absurdly early I get to the office, chances are I\u2019ll find several co-workers already meandering around blearily on their way to their productivity-enhancing, open-plan cubicles. We all see one another and nod without speaking, trying to establish a bit of personal space without the benefit of walls. In spite of those honest attempts, I know I will be drawn into social intercourse. If I\u2019m going to blast out of the gate, it\u2019s clear I\u2019m going to have to establish boundaries on this egalitarian factory floor. <em>Note to self:<\/em> Be ruder. Keep your head down. Look into the establishment of a physical frontier. Towers of books? Sheetrock?

But do they do so? Take my smartphone. It enables folks to reach me anytime for productive labor. By noon I have been reached by my wife, who is an excellent raconteur, by my friend Osborne, who is separating from his spouse, and by a guy from Petaluma who seems to have stepped in cow flop and needs a hand reestablishing professional equanimity. Only the last of these conversations, in truth, was productive. <em>Note to self:<\/em> Turn off smartphone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But wait. That same intelligent implement gives me the power to work day and night, increasing the ways I can benefit the shareholders we love. Unfortunately, it also sports a terrific camera, access to my music in the cloud, and a host of helpful apps. Right now I\u2019m on level 314 of Two Dots. It\u2019s totally immersive. Watch out for the in-app purchases, though. That furshlugginer game has cost me upwards of $500 already in power-ups. Of course, that\u2019s nothing compared with the more than a thousand bucks I\u2019ve spent on body armor in Infinity Blade. <em>Note to self:<\/em> Erase all apps.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">And how about email? How much of my in-box is a waste of time? Sixty percent? Eighty percent? Could intense, non-virtual interface be the only productive alternative to digital brain frizz? Yes! Meetings! Although, come to think of it, I had so many meetings yesterday I didn\u2019t get to anything I wanted to do. Not productive! <em>Note to self:<\/em> Work longer hours to undo the accumulation of duties produced by the ubiquity of meetings. Work through breakfast! Lunch! Dinner!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Okay, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here. Sleep very little. Avoid unnecessary social interactions. Eliminate time-wasting technology. Eschew meetings. Do lunch. Yeah. I can do all that. You can too, I\u2019ll bet. And then\u2014voil\u00e0!\u2014we\u2019ll achieve great heights together!

Think James Bond and his multi-thousand dollar watches, fitted suits, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/09\/28\/bond-aston-martin-spectre\/\">Aston Martin<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/09\/28\/bond-aston-martin-spectre\/\">s<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But for former FBI director James Comey, the reality is a little less explosive. Comey was set to earn $172,100 of his base salary in 2017, according to data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opm.gov\/policy-data-oversight\/pay-leave\/salaries-wages\/salary-tables\/pdf\/2017\/EX.pdf\">Office of Personnel Management<\/a> (OPM). He may have also been eligible to earn an additional $15,000 based on his performance in 2017. But then President <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/10\/james-comey-fired-publicly\/\">Donald Trump fired Comey<\/a> Tuesday night\u2014and now Comey is looking at a severance package rather than his full annual salary.<\/p>\n<p>When CEOs running a company are dismissed, they are often given a severance package representing a big chunk, if not more, of their annual pay. For instance, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/13\/yahoo-marissa-mayer-severance-2\/\">Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer<\/a> earned $27 million in 2016 in stock, options, and cash. And after <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a> completes its purchase of Yahoo, Mayer will be out with a hefty additional $23 million as her golden parachute.<\/p>\n<p>If Comey were any other federal employee, he would receive a severance close to about $32,254 for his 3 years, 8 months, and 7 days of service at the FBI, and his 56 years and 7 months of age, according to the OPM, website.<\/p>\n<p>But since Comey is a presidential appointee\u2014his severance is, well, zero, according to the OPM.<\/p>\n<p>Not that the lack of severance would leave Comey financially unstable: At the time of his nomination in 2013, Comey&#8217;s net worth was estimated at more than $11 million, <a href=\"http:\/\/politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com\/2013\/07\/08\/fbi-nominee-reports-net-worth-tops-11-million\/\">according<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com\/2013\/07\/08\/fbi-nominee-reports-net-worth-tops-11-million\/\"> to CNN.<\/a> This was thanks in part to his cushy job at the world&#8217;s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater, where he worked prior to joining the FBI.<\/p>\n<p>Comey is also not exactly leaving the FBI in disgrace. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/10\/james-comey-fired-bridgewater-ray-dalio\/\">Hedge fund managers<\/a> and politicians <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/10\/donald-trump-james-comey-firing-thank-him\/\">have come to his defense<\/a>, while those on both sides of the aisle are questioning <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/11\/white-house-james-comey-fired-different-explanations\/\">Trump&#8217;s rational for firing Comey<\/a>. The attorney general&#8217;s office said the decision was due to Comey&#8217;s handling of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/11\/05\/fbi-hillary-clinton-emails\/\">Hillary Clinton emails<\/a> case, but critics are questioning whether or not <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/11\/james-comey-fired-trump-russia-investigation\/\">Comey&#8217;s investigation<\/a> regarding Russia&#8217;s influence on the U.S. election had something to do with it.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to Comey, the Trump administration <a

Music and sports programs as well as student activities like college newspapers have been the first on the chopping block.<\/p>\n<p>International students bring in $39 billion in revenue to colleges and universities, according to the <em>Times<\/em>. They are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/president-trump-immigration-policies-making-schools-lose-money-769258\">particularly valuable<\/a> to the schools they attend because they tend to pay more tuition than other students. At state schools, international students don&#8217;t qualify for in-state tuition; at private schools, they don&#8217;t qualify for some types of financial aid, and therefore are more likely to pay full tuition.<\/p>\n<p>While the Trump administration has not officially capped student visas, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/visas-issued-to-foreign-students-fall-partly-due-to-trump-immigration-policy-1520766000\">universities say<\/a> students who apply for visas are undergoing greater scrutiny, and that \u2014 after a review ordered by the President \u2014 consular guides have been updated to encourage less leniency. Other factors, such as increasing competition with universities in other English-speaking countries, and less support for international study from some governments, have contributed to the decline in enrollment. Still, experts say the Trump administration&#8217;s contributions to the issue are not trivial.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 12, 2018","published":"2018-03-12 08:57:35","updated":"2018-03-12

Donald Trump can pitch, that a major economic revival is energizing America for a new run at greatness, and that he\u2019s the straw stirring the elixir.

In Trump\u2019s first three full quarters in the White House, GDP clocked growth just shy of his vaunted goal of 3%, a performance that by recent standards looks stellar. The stock market has added a quarter to its value since the election, a $5 trillion vote of confidence. The jaunty outlook is recharging animal spirits in corner offices: In its January survey of small companies, the National Federation of Independent Business found that 32% of the enterprises rated the present climate \u201ca good time to expand\u201d; that was a record high and a threefold increase from late 2016.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing.

The looming profit surge has prompted more than 200 <i>Fortune<\/i> 500 companies to raise their minimum pay (U.S. Bancorp, Humana), issue one-time bonuses to employees (Home Depot, Walt Disney), or both.<\/p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s heady economic potion, however, is masking misguided policies that could leave those same businesses with a severe hangover from today\u2019s celebration. The U.S. government\u2019s huge and growing budget deficits have become gargantuan enough to threaten the great American growth machine. And Trump\u2019s policies to date\u2014a combination of deep tax cuts and sharp spending increases\u2014are shortening the fuse on that fiscal time bomb, by dramatically widening the already unsustainable gap between revenues and outlays. On our current course, we\u2019re headed for a morass of punitive taxes, puny growth, and stagnant incomes for workers\u2014a future that\u2019s the precise opposite of what Trump champions.<\/p>\n<p>By 2028, America\u2019s government debt burden could explode from this year\u2019s $15.5 trillion to a staggering $33 trillion\u2014more than 20% bigger than it would have been had Trump\u2019s agenda not passed. At that point, interest payments would absorb more than $1 in $5 of federal revenue, crippling the government\u2019s \u00adcapacity to bolster the economy, and constraining the private sector too. Contrary to the claims of the President and his supporters, the U.S. can\u2019t grow fast enough to shed this burden; indeed, Trump\u2019s agenda on immigration and trade looks likely to stunt that growth. (More on that later.) \u201cThis is almost like climate change,\u201d says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do you in this year, or next year, but you\u2019ll see the ill effects in a day of reckoning.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2316924\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/def-04-18-opener-crop\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DEF.04.18.-opener-crop\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2316924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-opener-crop.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">ILLUSTRATION BY NIGEL BUCHANAN<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In the absence of decisive, quick action to tackle this slow-motion crisis, the best-case scenario for the next few years is that America becomes a much riskier place to do business. A high debt load will limit our flexibility to keep the economy on an even course. \u201cCountries with high debt don\u2019t respond aggressively to downturns,\u201d says Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff. If the U.S. slips into recession, we\u2019ll lack the option of lowering taxes or increasing spending on infrastructure, for example, as tools to revive growth. And as the debt load grows, efforts by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy with lower rates would be more likely to feed runaway inflation. \u201cThen, investors will dump Treasuries,\u201d says John Cochrane, an economist at the Hoover Institution. \u201cThat will drive rates far higher, and make the budget picture even worse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now Washington is neglecting the coming crunch, and that should make business leaders plenty worried, says David Cote, the recently retired CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/honeywell-international\/\" target=\"_blank\">Honeywell<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"hon\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:hon\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/honeywell-international\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">hon<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>.

Though the commission\u2019s platform died in Congress, it drew praise for its balanced approach to raising revenues and reforming Medicare and Social Security. Cote says that even though the problem is far more dire today, policymakers are digging a deeper hole. \u201cWe made a grand, bipartisan bargain in Simpson-Bowles to reform entitlements and raise taxes,\u201d Cote tells <i>Fortune,<\/i> noting that prior to the Great Recession, the ratio of debt to GDP was 35%.

One danger is that foreign investors, alarmed both by our crushing debt and the absence of plans to tame it, could dump our Treasuries, pushing interest rates higher. \u201cA one point rise in rates adds $200 billion every year to the debt,\u201d says Cote. A jump in yields would also raise the threshold at which new investments become profitable, forcing companies to retrench.<\/p>\n<p>Corporate leaders may also fret that the only solution to our debt woes is a jolting rise in taxes. \u201cThat would have a huge impact on how businesses view the investment climate,\u201d Cote says. \u201cCompanies will get worried and pull back on investment and wait and see.\u201d But to wait and see, he predicts, is to court stagnation and deterioration. That kind of stasis would turn the good economic news of President Trump\u2019s first year into a short story.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Of course, America\u2019s fiscal picture was becoming unsustainable well before Trump took office. What\u2019s astounding is how much worse his tax cuts and spending increases have rendered the outlook, and how quickly.<\/p>\n<p>The causes of this menace to prosperity are twofold. First, the U.S. has long chosen to lavish seniors, and to a lesser extent support the poor, with European-style benefits, while borrowing to fund those programs rather than levying European-style taxes. It\u2019s a politically popular path: In a poll released last April, the Pew Research Center asked voters whether they supported spending reductions to 14 specific budget areas. A majority of Democrats opposed cuts to any, while Republicans endorsed shrinking just one, \u201cassistance to needy people around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That brings us to the second point. Trump has championed, and Congress has enacted, two laws that go in the opposite direction of fiscal reform.<\/p>\n<p>According to Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, the Tax Cuts act, signed in December, will decrease expected revenues by a total of $1 trillion over the next 10 years, an average of $100 billion annually, even after any boost to growth and incomes from lower taxes. That number assumes that most of the personal income-tax reductions expire in eight years, and a break for expensing capital equipment starts phasing out in 2023. \u201cThose breaks are extremely likely to be renewed,\u201d says Brian Riedl of the conservative Manhattan Institute\u2014and in that more likely scenario, he projects, the tax plan will lower revenues by $160 billion over the following decade.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2316992\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/debt_and_interest\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=1024&#038;h=699\" data-orig-size=\"1400,956\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"debt_and_interest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=1024&#038;h=699?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=1024&#038;h=699?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2316992 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=1024&#038;h=699\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"699\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=1024&amp;h=699 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=150&amp;h=102 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=300&amp;h=205 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png?w=768&amp;h=524 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/debt_and_interest.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The February federal budget deal, meanwhile, hikes outlays in both of the two categories of \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending, defense and federal programs from foreign aid to housing subsidies, by an unprecedented 12%, or $150 billion a year in 2018 and 2019.

Because of the new laws, America will exceed the $1 trillion mark much earlier, in 2019, assuming current tax and spending policies are extended, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). Those probable shortfalls will keep ballooning even if the economy thrives. Under the CBO\u2019s forecast, deficits would have reached roughly $1.6 trillion in 2028 without the new laws. Now, the CRFB predicts a shortfall of $2.4 trillion. Largely owing to the deficit-widening measures, the U.S. in a decade will borrow $1 in every $3 it spends, vs. $1 in $4 if outlays and revenues had remained on their prior path.<\/p>\n<p>In a decade, federal debt will reach an overwhelming $33 trillion, the equivalent of 113% of GDP\u2014and $6 trillion higher than the CBO had forecast before the Trump agenda passed. Interest on U.S. borrowings would become the fastest-growing item in the federal budget, more than tripling to almost $1.1 trillion annually. At that point, carrying costs would equal one-half of spending on Medicare, and if inflation or interest rates exceeded the relatively low thresholds in the CBO\u2019s forecasts, the interest bill would soar even higher. \u201cThat increase represents money the U.S. is just throwing away\u2014that\u2019s crowding out the funding on everything from health care to the military,\u201d says Marc Goldwein, the CRFB\u2019s senior policy director.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2317021\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/global_debt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=1024&#038;h=699\" data-orig-size=\"1400,956\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"global_debt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=1024&#038;h=699?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=1024&#038;h=699?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2317021 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=1024&#038;h=699\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"699\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=1024&amp;h=699 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=150&amp;h=102 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=300&amp;h=205 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png?w=768&amp;h=524 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/global_debt.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That crowding out has real consequences. The cost of servicing the exploding debt would exert tremendous pressure on the government to eliminate investments that could fuel growth. In the past, spending that modernized highways and mass-transit systems or enhanced higher education has boosted the productivity of America\u2019s workers. That raises incomes, boosts savings rates, lifts consumer spending, and swells savings that fund private investment. The interest burden generated by the mushrooming debt threatens to turn this virtuous cycle into an unaffordable luxury.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to say whether a fiscal crisis, or growing outrage over the alarming numbers, might prompt corrective action before that happens. What\u2019s certain, says Sarah Carlson, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, is that \u201cthe longer we wait, the tougher the choices on benefits cuts and tax increases become.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet as Cote points out, policymakers are showing no willingness to take the unpopular, potentially radical steps needed to restore America\u2019s fiscal balance. A sign of just how far Congress has shifted away from fiscal caution is the Senate vote on Feb. 9 to raise discretionary spending: Opposition from Republican budget hawks such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah was overwhelmed by the 34 GOP Senators who joined 36 Democrats in the upper chamber to pass the deficit-swelling measure. Nor is Trump likely to fill the fiscal-responsibility vacuum: The President failed to even mention fiscal \u201cdeficits\u201d or \u201cdebt\u201d a single time in his 5,866-word State of the Union Address.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>There is one scenario in which the U.S. could stay on its current course, and that\u2019s to keep blithely borrowing from the rest of the world. America has been able to play the spendthrift because foreign lenders have shown a huge appetite for both our government and corporate debt\u2014they now own $6 trillion of our $15.5 trillion in publicly owned Treasuries.<\/p>\n<p>For most nations, such colossal borrowings would push interest rates higher as the government competes with business for a limited pool of lendable assets. But for decades, that hasn\u2019t been the case for the U.S.: A worldwide glut of savings from Chinese, Japanese, and other overseas investors holds our rates in check. The U.S. is, for now, the world\u2019s most powerful, well-diversified, and entrepreneurial economy, and in times of global stress, \u00admoney pours into the safest of all safe havens, the United States. The Great Recession only proved the thesis. \u201cWe exported a financial crisis to the rest of the world, and they sent us their money,\u201d says UC\u2013Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding:0 37px 13px;\" class=\"np\">\n\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr class=\"table-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"tfoot\" align=\"center\" style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td align=\"center\" style=\"line-height:20px; mso-line-height-rule:at-least;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/ico-02.png?w=26&#038;h=20\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"26\" height=\"20\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding:0 45px 24px;\" class=\"block-38\">\n\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\tThe president failed to even mention \u201cdeficits\u201d or \u201cdebt\u201d a single time in his 5,866-word state of the Union address.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"font:300 italic 13px\/17px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#000;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\n<p>But assuming that the rest of the world will continue to turn a blind eye to American profligacy is a risky bet, and it will get riskier if Congress keeps skirting the tough choices for the next 10 years. A full-blown Greece-in-2010-style debacle\u2014a slowdown of the economy, coupled with punitive interest rates, that forces major reforms\u2014is faintly possible but unlikely. A more probable plotline involves a scenario in which the annual debt numbers become so bad, and draw so much attention, that our looming fiscal cliff once again becomes a major political issue. Americans can get riled over gigantic budget deficits: Deficit anxiety after the excesses of the 1980s prompted a bipartisan deal to raise taxes and shrink deficits under the first President Bush in 1990.<\/p>\n<p>A cyclical downturn, a sharp decline in stock prices, or an unexpectedly steep increase in real interest rates dictated by skeptical overseas investors might be the catalyst that prompts legislators to get serious. It wouldn\u2019t cause catastrophe, but by lowering revenues or widening the already yawning deficits, it would train the spotlight on the potentially disastrous outlook. \u201cPolicymakers would form plans that wouldn\u2019t need to raise tons of money right now, but would kick in gradually,\u201d says Goldwein. In other words, they\u2019d shift the U.S. to a glide path that would reassure the markets.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2316989\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/deficit\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=1024&#038;h=802\" data-orig-size=\"1400,1096\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"deficit\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=1024&#038;h=802?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=1024&#038;h=802?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2316989\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=1024&#038;h=802\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"802\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=1024&amp;h=802 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png?w=768&amp;h=601 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/deficit.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:500px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-sidebar-johnson.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2316931\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/def-04-18-sidebar-johnson\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-sidebar-johnson.jpg?w=500&#038;h=333\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DEF.04.18.sidebar-Johnson\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;GREAT SOCIETY, BIG BILLS: The Vietnam War caused fiscal strains under President Lyndon Johnson.

But few outside the administration believe that America can expand at the 3% rate that Trump and Mnuchin are targeting. The CBO, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and World Bank all forecast an average reading of around 2% over the next decade. A major reason: a decline in the rate of workforce growth because of our aging population.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s highly unpredictable, and highly contradictory, approach to economic policy makes even 2% growth uncertain. Trump supports legislation that would reduce the annual number of legal immigrants by 50% over 10 years. \u201cThere\u2019s no more direct way to cut growth than restricting immigration,\u201d says Doug Duncan, chief economist at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/fannie-mae\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fannie Mae<\/a>. Duncan notes that foreign workers both start far more businesses than Americans, and that they\u2019re needed to avoid potentially crippling labor shortages in industries from farming to construction to tech. Trump is also delivering on what his business supporters hoped he\u2019d abandon: deploying tariffs to punish imports, starting with heavy duties on foreign-made steel and aluminum. \u201cTariffs raise prices for U.S. manufacturers using those materials, and slow sales and investment,\u201d says Moody\u2019s Zandi.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-deficit-bush-protestor.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2316926\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/def-04-18-deficit-bush-protestor\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/def-04-18-deficit-bush-protestor.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DEF.04.18.deficit-bush-protest\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A reveler wears a costume mocking President George W.

The overriding danger is that by pushing hard against traditional immigration and open trade, Trump could force the economy into a recession\u2014one that could be made worse because it would prompt investors to ask for higher interest on our already gigantic debt.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps more to the point: Even if GDP did wax at the 3% level that the Trump team seeks, the extra juice would lower total debt by only 10%, or $3 trillion, by 2028, according to the CRFB. \u201cAdding a point to growth won\u2019t come close to solving the problem,\u201d says Cote. To ensure long-term stability, policymakers will have to do something that\u2019s been almost unthinkable in recent memory\u2014simultaneously cut spending and pump up revenue.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The recent fiscal legislation caused negative, structural changes on both the spending and revenue fronts\u2014making the task of keeping the debt in check much harder than it would have been even a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the Trump tax cuts, the CBO was projecting that federal tax revenues would grow robustly, from 17.7% of GDP in 2018 to around 18.4% a decade later. But because of the cuts, revenues in 2018 are projected to be just 17.2% of national income. Government spending, meanwhile, was set to expand from 20.5% of GDP in 2018 to 23.6% in 2027 (the CBO did not project the figure after that date). But the February deal will trigger a huge jump in discretionary spending starting in 2019, raising the overall 2027 figure to 24.8% of GDP.<\/p>\n<p>A crucial plank in fiscal reform is slowing runaway spending on entitlements, chiefly Social Security and Medicare. Put simply, the nation\u2019s daunting demographic math dictates that the benefit programs keep absorbing bigger and bigger shares of national income. The cohort of Americans over age 65 is expanding much faster than the workforce; from 2017 to 2030, 20 million more baby boomers will reach retirement age, while only 14 million Americans will begin employment. The pool of seniors on Medicare is also getting older, and as a result, sicker. And older Americans vote, in huge numbers, to protect their privileges.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignleft\" style=\"max-width:350px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2317003\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/15\/us-national-debt-trump-tax-cuts\/gov_spendings\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=350&#038;h=370\" data-orig-size=\"700,740\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"gov_spendings\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=350&#038;h=370?w=284\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=350&#038;h=370?w=700\" class=\"wp-image-2317003\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=350&#038;h=370\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=350&amp;h=370 350w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=142&amp;h=150 142w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png?w=284&amp;h=300 284w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/gov_spendings.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Still, there are ways to slow entitlement growth. In Social Security, taxpayers will contribute about $1 to its trust fund for every $1.10 retirees are projected receive in benefits over the next decade. Indexing benefits to inflation instead of wages, the latter of which are forecast to grow 1.5 percentage points faster annually, would return the program to balance without damaging purchasing power. On Medicare, the government could restrain costs by gaining authority to negotiate prices for prescription drugs, and by reinstating the requirement that drugmakers provide rebates, a policy that generates savings for Medicaid but is barred for Medicare. Congress could also set doctors\u2019 fees for outpatient hospital visits to the lower rates charged for office consultations. Bolder moves include introducing market forces that turn patients into cost-conscious consumers. One prescription: Giving seniors fixed payments to buy private insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Getting military and other discretionary spending to grow less slowly won\u2019t be easy, but it has been done in the past. Congress should enact new spending caps along the lines of the Budget Control Act, which helped to shrink outlays as a share of national income from 2013 to 2017. But because we\u2019ve waited so long, even major spending reforms leave a big hole\u2014a chasm that can be filled only by taxes.<\/p>\n<p>The longer we wait to enact a solution, the higher the new levies required will need to go. <i>Fortune<\/i> ran numbers to calculate how much extra revenue the U.S. would need to raise, over the next decade, if it lowered the rate of growth in Social Security by one percentage point, reduced increases in Medicare, Medicaid, and other health care spending by a proportional amount, and held discretionary spending below growth in GDP (albeit from the higher base established by the new laws). For our purposes, we assumed that corporate tax increases are off the table under the current administration. Our goal was to come up with spending cuts and revenue increases that would keep the ratio of debt to GDP at or below where it was at the end of 2017, at 76%. Though that\u2019s around twice the average over the past 50 years, it\u2019s what would be affordable given the CBO\u2019s projections of low interest rates for years to come.<\/p>\n<p>So here\u2019s what the cost of sanity looks like. If we start reforms now, including the slowdown in spending, the government would need to phase in noncorporate tax increases averaging $900 billion a year from the end of 2018 through 2028. That would require raising federal tax collections by between 21% and 22% over that period. (That\u2019s more than twice the increase we would have needed if we\u2019d started now, without the recent deficit-ballooning legislation.) What if we wait four years, and begin our 10-year projections at the start of 2023? We\u2019d be coping with four more years of colossal growth in debt. To wrestle the debt-to-GDP ratio back to 76% by 2032, the U.S. would require an average tax increase of $1.2 trillion over today\u2019s baseline. That\u2019s a rise of 24%.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding:0 37px 13px;\" class=\"np\">\n\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr class=\"table-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"tfoot\" align=\"center\" style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td align=\"center\" style=\"line-height:20px; mso-line-height-rule:at-least;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/ico-02.png?w=26&#038;h=20\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"26\" height=\"20\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding:0 45px 24px;\" class=\"block-38\">\n\t\t\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\tIf congress hopes to solve the debt crisis, says one economist, \u201cwhatever they come up with will be something that seems impossible now.\u201d\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"font:300 italic 13px\/17px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#000;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<\/table>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\n<p>What kind of taxes could produce that bounty? \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten about as much money as we can out of the personal income tax,\u201d says Rudolph Penner, director of the CBO during the Reagan administration and now a fellow at the Urban Institute. Riedl, of the Manhattan Institute, reckons that doubling the top two personal rates to 70% and 74% respectively (politically a near-impossibility) would close just one-fifth of the projected shortfall from Medicare and Social Security over 30 years. Other proposals include a carbon tax on gasoline sales, limiting deductibility of state taxes for businesses by imposing the same caps that now apply to individuals, and taxing generous employer-provided health care plans.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s unlikely that anything close to the necessary number can be raised by tinkering with the existing tax code. Virtually every other industrialized country deploys consumption taxes to support their welfare states. On average, around 60% of those levies are value-added taxes, or VATs, which resemble a sales tax but are actually paid by companies as goods go through each stage of production. They raise, on average, about 6% of GDP, at typical rates of roughly 20%.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. doesn\u2019t have a VAT or a national sales tax\u2014and given how enormous a bite such taxes take out of income in other countries, it\u2019s easy to see why they haven\u2019t gained traction in Congress. But our fiscal plight is becoming so desperate that America may soon find itself embracing solutions it never before contemplated. \u201cA VAT won\u2019t happen under this President and this Congress, but its stock will rise,\u201d says William Gale, an economist at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. \u201cWhatever they come up with will seem to be something that\u2019s impossible now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, if our politicians finally grow a collective backbone and strive to put America\u2019s finances on a firm footing, the pain will be wrenching. Even though tax increases can be phased in, they\u2019ll still need to start at a high plateau because we\u2019ve waited so long, and they\u2019ll rise from there. America has never seen anything like the kind of tax hikes that could be in the cards. Over time, consumers will have less to spend on cars, appliances, iPhones, and vacations. Sales and profits will suffer. And the likely consumer pain might generate political pressure to undo at least some of the corporate tax cuts that Trump is so proud of.<\/p>\n<p>Dave Cote recalls that he favored a VAT when he first joined the Simpson-Bowles Commission. \u201cThen someone pointed out that the government doesn\u2019t need a new engine to collect taxes, and I changed to opposing the VAT because it would just keep ratcheting up spending.\u201d But government spending has ratcheted up anyway\u2014now with the blessing of the Republican legislative majority and a populist President. On budget matters, the irresistible force of Americans\u2019 love for rich benefits collides with the immovable object of Americans\u2019 resistance to high taxes. As the old Johnny Mercer song goes, \u201cSomething\u2019s Gotta Give.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the April 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Deep in

target=\"_blank\">Constellation Brands<\/a>, which distributes popular <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/06\/corona-maker-sales-wall-street\/\">Mexican lager Corona<\/a> in the United States, is rolling out a new lower-calorie version of the beer: Corona Premier, the first new Corona-branded beer in 29 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The new beer is meant for light beer drinkers who are looking for an upgrade in what they drink while sticking to a brand they\u2019re familiar with. Exact pricing will vary depending on the market, but Constellation has said that the beer will cost the same as Corona and Corona Light. Those beers cost 40% more than traditional light beers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/does-america-really-need-another-light-beer-corona-thinks-so-1520341200?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1#comments_sector\"><em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> reports<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The company is pitching the new beer to men over 35.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for how it\u2019s different from traditional Corona, the new Premier version has 2.6 grams of carbohydrates and 90 calories compared to 148 calories and 13 grams of carbs in a traditional 12 oz. Corona. Corona Light has 99 calories and 5 grams of carbohydrates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Constellation describes Premier as \u201cperfectly balanced with a touch of sweetness and a clean and pleasantly dry finish.\u201d It says the beer has an aroma of \u201cfruit-honey with a touch of malt\u201d and that it is \u201cthe smoothest, most drinkable Corona.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The beer, which is starting to roll out to retailers now, will be sold nationwide in both cans and bottles. <\/span><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 8,

Before the day was through, he had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/tasmanian-admits-gun-massacre-1351256.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shot dead 35 people<\/a> and wounded 18 others. Twelve of those deaths came at the Broad Arrow Caf\u00e9, where Bryant first ate lunch and then sprayed bullets with his Colt AR-15 SP1, which he had stowed in a tennis bag. At the gift shop next door, he murdered eight more people. Later, he shot a <a href=\"https:\/\/skeptoid.com\/episodes\/4253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">young mother running away<\/a> with her two children\u2014all three at close range.<\/p>\n<p>He was a loner, with a clean-shaven face and wavy blond hair. His IQ was said to be 66. By all accounts, he was a terrible shot. But with the weapons he carried\u2014the AR-15 and a second, self-loading military-style rifle\u2014aim was almost immaterial. The SP1 could fire several rounds per second with little recoil. Pointing the gun at a crowd of tourists, it was hard not to hit somebody.<\/p>\n<p>If all this sounds too horrifically familiar\u2014an estranged loner, an AR-15, dozens dead in a matter of minutes\u2014there is a remarkable twist to the story. In the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, Australian lawmakers did something about it.<\/p>\n<p>Within just weeks of that tragedy, elected officials in each of Australia\u2019s six states and two mainland territories\u2014pressed forward by police chiefs across the continent and by the then-newly elected prime minister\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/law\/help\/firearms-control\/australia.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned semi-automatic and other military-style weapons<\/a> across the country. The federal government of Australia prohibited their import, and lawmakers introduced a generous nationwide gun buyback program, funded with a Medicare tax, to encourage Australians to freely give up their assault-style weapons. Amazingly, many of them did. (<a href=\"http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/12\/6\/365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simon Chapman<\/a>, an emeritus professor in public health at the University of Sydney, and an influential proponent of the original firearms legislation, has a <a href=\"http:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-arguments-that-carried-australias-1996-gun-law-reforms-58431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very good summary here<\/a>. You can also read his free <a href=\"https:\/\/ses.library.usyd.edu.au\/bitstream\/2123\/8938\/1\/Over-our-dead-bodies_Chapman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ebook<\/a> here.)<\/p>\n<p>A land of roughneck pioneers and outback settlers, Australia had never embraced much government regulation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/law\/help\/firearms-control\/firearms-control.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certainly not about their guns<\/a>. This was a land of almost cartoonish toughness and self-reliance, home of Crocodile Dundee and Australian rules football. Here even the kangaroos box. But Port Arthur had followed too many prior deadly shooting sprees and Australians were clearly sick to death of them.<\/p>\n<p>So what happened after the assault-weapon ban? Well therein lies the other half of the story twist noted above: <em>Nothing<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing, that is, in a good way.<\/p>\n<p>Australian independence didn\u2019t end. Tyranny didn\u2019t come. Australians still hunted and explored and big-wave surfed to their hearts\u2019 content. Their economy didn\u2019t crash; Invaders never arrived. Violence, in many forms, went down across the country, not up. Somehow, lawmakers on either side of the gun debate managed to get along and legislate.<\/p>\n<p>As for mass killings, there were no more. Not one in the past 22 years.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, a mentally impaired student at Monash University in Melbourne shot two people dead and injured five others. He came to his rampage with six handguns, not an assault rifle. Had he been carrying an AR-15, the toll would have been far worse. But even so, Australian lawmakers added a new National Handgun Agreement, a separate buyback act, and a reformulated gun trafficking policy to their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/law\/help\/firearms-control\/australia.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legislative arsenal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There has been no similar shooting spree since.<\/p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t just the murderous rampages that faded away. Gun violence in general declined over the following two decades to a nearly unimaginable degree. In 2014, the latest year for which final statistics are available, Australia\u2019s murder rate fell to less than 1 killing per 100,000 people\u2014a murder rate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/nvsr\/nvsr65\/nvsr65_04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-fifth<\/a> the size of America\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2017\/jun\/18\/australias-rate-falls-to-record-low-of-one-person-per-100000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Just 32 of those homicides<\/a>\u2014in a nation of 24 million people\u2014were committed with guns. By comparison, more than 500 people were shot dead last year in the city of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/chicago-violence-600-homicides-2017-457717673.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chicago<\/a> alone. (Chicago has about 2.7 million residents.)<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most remarkable is what happened with gun suicides in Australia in the wake of the post-Port Arthur firearm legislation. They <a href=\"http:\/\/andrewleigh.org\/pdf\/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped by some 80 percent<\/a>, according to one analysis.<\/p>\n<p>What stopped many of those would-be suicides\u2014quite straightforwardly, it seems\u2014was the lack of access to a gun, a generally immediate and effective method of killing. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3518361\/pdf\/AJPH.2012.300964.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine out of 10<\/a> suicide attempts with a firearm result in death, a far higher share than attempts by other methods.)

In 2015, an unthinkable 22,103 Americans shot themselves to death with a gun (see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/nvsr\/nvsr66\/nvsr66_06_tables.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Table I-21<\/a>)\u2014accounting for just over half of the suicides in the country that year.<\/p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t hard to imagine what would happen without all those guns at the ready.

href=\"https:\/\/www.fuw.ch\/article\/we-dont-know-how-to-replace-the-great-big-gold-deposits-from-the-past\/\"><em>Finanz und Wirtschaft<\/em><\/a> this month, Pierre Lassonde, co-founder and chairman of mining royalty company Franco-Nevada, said he\u2019s not sure how the world will be able to keep up the pace of discovery of gold deposits that it has enjoyed over the last century.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What the industry has not done anywhere near enough is to put money back into exploration,&#8221; <span class=\"s1\">Lassonde<\/span> told the paper. &#8220;They have not put anywhere near enough money into research and development, particularly for new technologies with respect to exploration and processing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the long term, he warns, there could be a supply-demand imbalance and an increase in the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/25\/gold-market-surge-mysterious-trade\/\">price of gold<\/a> around the world. The issue, in part, is that mining has slowed down due to increased costs and decreased discovery of new mining locations. The Trump administration <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/06\/donald-trump-gold-price-goldman-sachs\/\">has also been blamed<\/a> for the recent surge in gold prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lassonde, as well as Frank Holmes, who wrote an article about the issue for <em>U.S. Global Investors<\/em>, suggests that investors should start including gold in their portfolio if they haven\u2019t already. Holmes recommends keeping between 5 and 10 percent of your portfolio in gold, and adding gold stocks to the mix, particularly <a

Cost Taxpayers $1 Million","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reportedly racked up a nearly $1 million tab on taxpayer-funded trips since taking office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">According to Washington watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citizensforethics.org\/travels-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">CREW<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">), Mnuchin has frequently opted for <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/13\/treasury-steve-mnuchin-louise-linton-jet-europe-honeymoon\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">using military aircraft for his travel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> instead of taking commercial planes, which would come at a much lower cost to the taxpayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In a new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citizensforethics.org\/travels-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, CREW detailed findings obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Between the spring and fall of 2017, Mnuchin reportedly took eight trips on military planes, totaling close to $1 million. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Existing law dictates that government aircrafts are to be used only for \u201cofficial purposes,\u201d and when there is \u201cno commercial airline or aircraft&#8230;reasonably available,\u201d reports CREW. The reports do not show that the trips in question received &#8220;White House Mission&#8221; designation, meaning they were made for official purposes. In addition, CREW contends that commercial planes were in fact &#8220;reasonably available&#8221; for several of these trips, and significantly less expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The report goes on to allege that Mnuchin has \u201cabused\u201d his \u201ceasy access to military and other non-commercial aircraft for both business travel and what, upon closer inspection, appears to sometimes include personal travel.\u201d Nevertheless, CREW conceded that several of Mnuchin\u2019s predecessors had similarly used military aircraft for international travel. Where Mnuchin differed, however, was his apparent unwillingness to use commercial planes for domestic travel, the cost of which has totaled close to $200,000 to date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A number of Trump administration officials have been scrutinized for their use of government funds in recent months. Ben Carson reportedly <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/01\/ben-carson-hud-furniture\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">canceled a $31,000 furniture order<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> earlier this month and Scott Pruitt reportedly spent <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/27\/epa-building-25k-soundproof-booth-for-scott-pruitt\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">$25,000 on a soundproof booth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/02\/14\/epa-scott-pruitt-first-class-travel\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">publicly defended his first-class travel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Health Secretary Tom Price <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/29\/tom-price-resigns\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">resigned in September<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> after his costly travel was revealed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tony Sayegh, Treasury&#8217;s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement that CREW&#8217;s report contains &#8220;falsehoods and mischaracterizations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even CREW concedes that the Secretary\u2019s travel requests &#8216;bear a remarkable similarity&#8217; to the requests submitted by secretaries in the Obama Administration, using the same approval process and level of justification. The documents CREW cites are the same documents that were examined by Treasury\u2019s Inspector General in his review of Treasury\u2019s travel, in which he identified no violation of law, regulation, or ethics requirements,&#8221; Sayegh said.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Sayegh&#8217;s statement.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 06:47:33","updated":"2018-03-16 06:47:33","minute":"6:47 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/steve-mnuchin-travel-military-planes-cost-taxpayers-1-milllion\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/steve-mnuchin-travel-military-planes-cost-taxpayers-1-milllion\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/steve-mnuchin-travel-military-planes-cost-taxpayers-1-milllion\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"49\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5577223984001-49\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5577223984001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2DvJcZu\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/executive-travel_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dnationalsecurity%2Cpoliticalnews%2Cstevenmnuchin%2Ctravel%2Cwhitehouse%26ch%3Dexecutivetravel%26topic%3Dstevenmnuchin&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>He opts for military planes instead of flying commercial.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2104500","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/natasha-bach\/","name":"Natasha Bach","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"bachnatasha@gmail.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"2157653\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=2157653\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bach\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/bach1.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":1875350,"name":"Executive Travel","slug":"executive-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":129962,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice to help globe-trotting executives travel smarter.

The deal will enable IBM to outsource various IT security functions while granting Cloudflare access to IBM&#8217;s network of customers through a reseller agreement.<\/p>\n<p>John Considine, IBM&#8217;s general manager for cloud infrastructure, tells <em>Fortune<\/em> that the product bundling will &#8220;hugely simplify things for end users.&#8221; The integration, he says, will let IBM customers easily add Cloudflare&#8217;s defenses, including shields against <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/10\/22\/ddos-attack-hacker-profit\/\">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks<\/a> and firewalls for filtering out malicious Internet traffic.<\/p>\n<p>IBM customers will be able to use Cloudflare&#8217;s services, branded under IBM Cloud Internet Services, by &#8220;most of the time just clicking a button in the dashboard,&#8221; says Matthew Prince, Cloudflare&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. Access to the features is set to open on March 19.<\/p>\n<p>For Cloudflare, the deal represents the third reseller agreement it has inked with big cloud providers in recent years. The company already has similar relationships in place with <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a> Cloud and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a> Azure.

class=\"article\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>The collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. is yet another blow for landlords, who now will have gaping holes of suburban retail space up for grabs. And few tenants would want them.<\/p>\n<p>The debt-laden toy chain, with more than 700 stores across the U.S., became one of the largest victims of the retail decline when it announced on Thursday that it would go out of business after a failed rescue effort. The liquidation could dump millions of square feet of real estate onto a market that\u2019s already bloated with vacancies from retailer bankruptcies and store closures, a trend that\u2019s been escalating as shoppers increasingly turn to the internet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really tough right now to find a solution for something that\u2019s that big and with that many locations,\u201d Jan Kniffen, a retail consultant and founder of J. Rogers Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises, said in an interview. \u201cHow many people need more stores right now? How many people need more square footage? Not very many.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has stores in all types of shopping properties &#8212; from standalone locations to community strip centers to large regional malls. Many centers are in the hands of publicly traded real estate investment trusts that lease space to the chain and may struggle with declining values for the properties. Some stores are owned by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us itself.<\/p>\n<p>How successful landlords will be in filling empty stores will depend on the quality of the properties and their locations, according to research by CoStar Group Inc. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us owns many of the stores in weaker areas, while GGP Inc., the second-biggest U.S. mall REIT, tends to have some of the best locations and would have the easiest time finding new tenants, according to CoStar. Somewhere in the middle are companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/simon-property-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Property Group<\/a> Inc., GGP\u2019s larger rival, and Kimco Realty Corp., the research firm said.<\/p>\n<p>Representatives for GGP and Simon declined to comment. A Kimco representative didn\u2019t return a call.<\/p>\n<p>Even with vacancies, some properties are still \u201cviable commercial real estate,\u201d Ed Reardon, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients. Locations at power centers &#8212; properties anchored by discount department stores or warehouse clubs &#8212; would be easier to fill than standalone locations, with expanding retailers such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/michaels-cos\/\" target=\"_blank\">Michaels Cos.<\/a>, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc., <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/tjx\/\" target=\"_blank\">TJX<\/a> Cos. and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ross-stores\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Stores<\/a> Inc. among the likeliest contenders for the space, he said.<\/p>\n<p>Other chains with locations of roughly the same size as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stores, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/best-buy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy<\/a> Co. and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bed-bath-beyond\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond<\/a> Inc., are focusing on expanding their online businesses and remodeling existing stores rather than adding new locations. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/target\/\" target=\"_blank\">Target<\/a> Corp. has said it plans to open dozens of smaller stores over the next two years, but they\u2019ll be in cities and near colleges campuses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have great locations across the country, and the stores are working,\u201d Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said in a March 9 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s sad when a company folds, but it is what it is.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, based in Wayne, New Jersey, has been saddled with debt since 2005, when Bain Capital, KKR &amp; Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took the company private in a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout. Vornado\u2019s retail spinoff, Urban Edge Properties, has Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stores at some of its centers, CoStar data show.<\/p>\n<p>Divide and conquer may be the solution for much of the real estate, with multiple smaller businesses such as restaurants or movie theaters carving up the large Toys \u201cR\u201d Us spaces. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s potentially less lucrative for landlords.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll just have to cobble it together one individual location at a time,\u201d said Kniffen. \u201cThey are going to be going into uses that drive a hell of a lot less in sales per square foot than these guys did, which means you just can\u2019t charge as much in the way of rent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Splitting the space would also add costs for landlords, while filling the stores with off-price retailers would require less reconfiguring, RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts led by Wes Golladay said in a note Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>The departure of a tenant as big as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us may give some landlords the opportunity to reinvent their shopping centers and upgrade the tenant mix to be more internet-proof. Landlord DDR Corp. has indicated that two of the closures would lead to redevelopments, Golladay said in the note.<\/p>\n<p>A DDR representative didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.<\/p>\n<p>With other big-box retailers, such as office-supply chain <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/staples\/\" target=\"_blank\">Staples<\/a> Inc., potentially closing stores of a similar size, \u201cthe potential replacement tenants have a lot of negotiating power\u201d with landlords, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Reardon said in an interview. \u201cThe competition is not that intense.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"attachments\"><\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 11:33:50","updated":"2018-03-16 11:33:50","minute":"11:33 AM

defining itself <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/go\/tech\/spotify-ipo-what-you-need-to-know\/\">by what it won\u2019t do<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It won\u2019t engage in silly, self-congratulatory bell ringing on the day of its initial public offering. It won\u2019t offer new shares to investors\u2014only the shares of existing shareholders, who won\u2019t be constrained by a traditional \u201clockup\u201d period enforced by Wall Street underwriters. And it won\u2019t market its IPO behind closed doors. Thursday Spotify took the highly unusual step of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.setcreative.com\/spotify-roadshow\/\">livestreaming its investor<\/a> \u201croadshow\u201d presentation in New York.<\/p>\n<p>Whether Spotify\u2019s shares sink or swim, these are tremendously exciting developments in part because they upend the established narrative of recent years. Many companies say they have no need to go public. Yet once they do they turn a financing event into an unseemly party. Spotify, which rakes in billions but doesn\u2019t make money, is being clear about why it\u2019s going public: so investors, including employees, can sell stock more broadly.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify represents the next chapter of \u201cunicorn\u201d financing. As it pointed out in a video accompanying its presentation, it has raised ample capital and its stock has changed hands privately for years. There\u2019s no need for faux secrecy either. I could never understand why companies about to sell shares to the public made their pitches behind closed doors. Spotify even is being upfront about when it will publicly release its financial forecast (March 26) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2018\/3\/15\/17124640\/spotify-first-day-of-trading-ipo-april-3\">begin trading<\/a> on the New York Stock Exchange (April 3) under the symbol SPOT.<\/p>\n<p>Have a harmonious weekend.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This article first appeared in Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the top tech news. <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sign up here<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>.<\/i><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 16, 2018","published":"2018-03-16 09:58:24","updated":"2018-03-16 09:58:24","minute":"9:58 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/spotify-ipo-date-terms\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/spotify-ipo-date-terms\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/03\/16\/spotify-ipo-date-terms\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Spotify Breaks the Mold","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"52\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5543679925001-52\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5543679925001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2FKe36r\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddirectipo%2Cdirectlisting%2Cfinance%2Cipo%2Cspotify%2Ctechnology%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dspotify&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Wall Street may be unhappy.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381316","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/adam-lashinsky\/","name":"Adam Lashinsky","twitter":"adamlashinsky","gplus":"","email":"adam_lashinsky@fortune.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599150\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/lashinsky-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Adam Lashinsky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Adam Lashinsky is the executive editor of <em>Fortune<\/em>.

Plans","content":"<p>Just 10 minutes before SpaceX was due to make its latest Falcon 9 launch on Wednesday, the company decided to delay it because of high-altitude winds. The launch, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, will now hopefully take place on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>One particularly interesting thing about this launch is its payload.

The first satellite built for two-way broadband communications\u2014e-BIRD, built by <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/boeing\/\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ba\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:ba\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/boeing\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ba<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> for the French-headquartered Eutelsat\u2014went up some 15 years ago. There have been many more since. However, so far it&#8217;s a relatively niche market.<\/p>\n<p>The advantage of satellite-based broadband is that it can cover entire regions without the need to build out expensive land-based internet infrastructure\u2014you just need a satellite dish to use it, which makes it good for serving rural areas. And while it started out pretty slow, it&#8217;s gotten a lot faster over the years (though it&#8217;s still not in the same league as a decent fiber connection).<\/p>\n<p>There are two big disadvantages, though (apart from interruptions due to cloud cover). The first is that it tends to be pretty expensive, and the second is that it usually suffers from high latency, because of how high the satellites are.<\/p>\n<p>Latency is the time it takes for a signal to get from one place to another. While it&#8217;s not a big issue when you&#8217;re sending emails or trying to view a static webpage, high latency can be a showstopper for video, virtual reality, and real-time communications.<\/p>\n<h2>So what&#8217;s SpaceX doing that&#8217;s different?<\/h2>\n<p>SpaceX&#8217;s idea is to put its satellites into much lower orbit than usual, in order to cut the latency of the services. A typical internet satellite in geostationary orbit is more than 22,000 miles above ground. According to SpaceX&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/licensing.fcc.gov\/cgi-bin\/ws.exe\/prod\/ib\/forms\/reports\/swr031b.hts?q_set=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC\/File+Number\/%3D\/SATLOA2016111500118&amp;prepare=&amp;column=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC\/File+Number&amp;utm_content=bufferda647\">FCC filings<\/a>, the company wants to put its Starlink satellites in low Earth orbit, between 684 and 823 miles in the air.<\/p>\n<p>The issue there, of course, is that bringing the satellites closer to the ground means each satellite can only cover a much smaller patch of territory than would otherwise be possible. So in order to provide competitive coverage, SpaceX will need a lot of satellites that all talk to one another.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the plan. Elon Musk&#8217;s company wants to initially deploy 800 satellites in low Earth orbit, in order to cover &#8220;initial U.S. and international coverage.&#8221; Then it wants to throw over 7,000 more into the sky at &#8220;Very Low Earth Orbit&#8221; (VLEO, in this case around 211 miles up) to fill in the blanks as needed.<\/p>\n<h2>That sounds\u2026 expensive?<\/h2>\n<p>Sure, but less so if you&#8217;re in the business of launching stuff already\u2014this week&#8217;s planned launch is a case in point, with SpaceX&#8217;s Microsat 2a and 2b satellites tucked in there alongside Spain&#8217;s Paz satellite. And don&#8217;t forget that SpaceX&#8217;s biggest innovation is being able to reuse its rockets.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX has already become adept at recovering and reusing the first stage (the body) of its Falcon 9 rockets, and it&#8217;s hoping to become as successful at recovering the fairing (the bit at the top, which contains the payload being sent into orbit). To do this, it&#8217;s built a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teslarati.com\/spacex-fairing-recovery-boat-using-giant-net\/\">giant net<\/a> with the delightful name of &#8220;Mr. Steven.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, SpaceX seems to want Starlink to be its big money-spinner, ultimately financing <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/15\/elon-musk-reddit-spacex-mars\/\">Musk&#8217;s Martian ambitions<\/a>. The company&#8217;s launches operate on thin margins\u2014a successful Internet business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/exclusive-peek-at-spacex-data-shows-loss-in-2015-heavy-expectations-for-nascent-internet-service-1484316455\">would bring in a lot more cash<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>And what are the challenges?<\/h2>\n<p>Apart from the numerous technical challenges that SpaceX faces, it&#8217;s also annoyed communications satellite operators such as OneWeb, which are worried that SpaceX&#8217;s vast planned constellation will pose a physical threat to their own satellites in low Earth orbit (which are generally used for voice communications).<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX has countered that its plans include plenty of space between satellites\u2014at least 31 miles\u2014and that it will also be developing &#8220;ongoing innovations&#8221; to reduce the risk of bringing its satellites down, once they reach the ends of their working lives.<\/p>\n<p>The company seems likely to get its way, albeit slowly. Earlier this month, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Ajit Pai <a href=\"https:\/\/transition.fcc.gov\/Daily_Releases\/Daily_Business\/2018\/db0214\/DOC-349224A1.pdf\">said<\/a> he was in favor of approving SpaceX&#8217;s application to operate its constellation. However, other bodies\u2014notably the International Telecommunication Union\u2014also need to give the green light. It will be some years before SpaceX&#8217;s service is fully operational.<\/p>\n<p>The other big challenge is competition. OneWeb, Telesat, and Space Norway have also received the FCC&#8217;s go-ahead for similar (if not quite so ambitious) satellite plans. Then there are rival plans that aren&#8217;t based on satellites, such as X&#8217;s (formerly <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a> X&#8217;s) Project Loon.<\/p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget good old mobile broadband. While some experts are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/5g-data-network-phones-4g\/\">skeptical about the practicalities<\/a>, one big promise of the looming &#8220;5G&#8221; cellular technology is that it will be able to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/06\/verizon-5g-test-small-towns\/\">provide broadband services to rural areas<\/a> that don&#8217;t currently get good fixed-line services.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of competitors out there for Musk&#8217;s scheme. But that said, the others don&#8217;t have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2015-01-13\/musk-to-build-satellites-in-seattle-in-drive-for-mars.html\">Mars on their

class=\"article\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> Inc. is preparing to release a trio of new smartphones later this year: the largest iPhone ever, an upgraded handset the same size as the current iPhone X and a less expensive model with some of the flagship phone\u2019s key features.<\/p>\n<p>With the new lineup, Apple wants to appeal to the growing number of consumers who crave the multitasking attributes of so-called phablets while also catering to those looking for a more affordable version of the iPhone X, according to people familiar with the products.<\/p>\n<p>Apple, which is already running production tests with suppliers, is expected to announce the new phones this fall. The plans could still change, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning.<\/p>\n<p>Despite months of breathless hype, the iPhone X hasn\u2019t sold as well as expected since its debut last year. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones in the final quarter of 2017, below analysts\u2019 projections of 80.2 million units. Some consumers were turned off by the iPhone X\u2019s $1,000 price despite liking the design even as they wanted something more cutting-edge than the cheaper iPhone 8. With its next lineup, Apple is seeking to rekindle sales by offering a model for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and a long-time Apple watcher. \u201cWhen you have a measurable upgrade in screen size, people go to update their phone in droves. We saw that with the iPhone 6, and we think this is setting up to be a similar step up in growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Munster predicts a supercycle &#8212; which he defines as upgrades by 10 percent or more of Apple\u2019s existing iPhone customers. \u201cThe market that will see the biggest jump in sales is likely Asia,\u201d he says. \u201cThat market has many single-device consumers, and they love big phones.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The shares gained 2.1 percent to $179.18 at 2:16 p.m. in New York.<\/p>\n<p>With a screen close to 6.5 inches, Apple\u2019s big new handset will be one of the largest mainstream smartphones on the market. While the body of the phone will be about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, the screen will be about an inch larger thanks to the edge-to-edge design used in the iPhone X. (Apple is unlikely to refer to the phone as a phablet, a term popularized by Samsung.)<\/p>\n<p>The larger screen should especially appeal to business users, letting them write emails and manage spreadsheets on a screen about as big as a small tablet. Like the iPhone 8 Plus, the new handset will probably enable split-screen modes for certain apps. Still, the larger phone could cannibalize iPad sales, a category that recently started growing again.<\/p>\n<p>The big phone is code named D33, a person familiar with its development says, and at least some prototypes include a screen resolution of 1242 x 2688. That would make the screen about as sharp as the one on the 5.8-inch iPhone X. Apple also plans to use OLED technology, the same, more expensive type of screen in the regular iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>Like the iPhone X, the larger model will include a Face ID scanner that unlocks the device and enables payments. Apple is also preparing an update to the regular-sized iPhone X that is internally dubbed D32, people familiar with the product said. Both of these phones are expected to use next-generation A12 processors and will continue to include stainless steel edges, they say, and will be Apple\u2019s high-end smartphone offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is considering a gold color option for the update to the iPhone X and the larger model. The company tried to develop gold for the current X handset, but abandoned it because of production problems. All new iPhones since the 5s came in gold, including the iPhone 8. The gold option is especially appealing to consumers in Asia and may help boost sales in the region. Still, Apple may ultimately decide not to proceed with the color.<\/p>\n<p>In at least some regions, Apple is considering offering a dual-SIM card option for the larger model. That would let people use their phones in countries with different carrier plans without having to swap out cards. Such a feature has been growing in importance and popularity, especially in Europe and Asia where business people routinely visit multiple countries.<\/p>\n<p>Apple hasn\u2019t made a final decision on including the feature and could choose to wait for E-SIM technology, which will connect phones to multiple networks without the need for a removable chip. Apple has wanted to offer E-SIM technology (it already exists in the iPad and Apple Watch), but some carriers are resistant to including it in iPhones, and Apple needs their support. A dual-SIM capability would provide a compromise.<\/p>\n<p>The phones will have an updated operating system, probably called iOS 12 and code named Peace, which will include upgraded augmented reality capabilities, deeper integration of the Siri digital assistant, digital health monitoring and the ability to use Animojis in FaceTime.<\/p>\n<p>Apple\u2019s decision to also build a cheaper phone is an acknowledgment that the current entry-level 8 models too closely resemble the iPhone 6 introduced back in 2014. With their thick bezels and lack of edge-to-edge screens, they seem dated next to the iPhone X and the latest Samsung devices. The new lower-cost model will feature the same edge-to-edge screen as the iPhone X as well as Face ID instead of a fingerprint sensor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019re rounding out the product line\u201d with a less expensive phone, Munster says. But he doesn\u2019t think it will have a measurable impact on demand because many consumers will want the bigger model.<\/p>\n<p>To keep costs down, the cheaper phone will use LCD screen technology similar to the type employed in the iPhone 8. It will also have aluminum edges and a glass back like the iPhone 8, not the flashier stainless steel used in the iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has tried selling cheaper phones in the past with poor results. In 2013, the company debuted the iPhone 5c, which had a polycarbonate body and came in various colors. Consumers quickly discovered that for a mere $100 more they could buy a 5s, which had an aluminum body, a slow-motion video camera and a fingerprint scanner. Apple soon discontinued the 5c.<\/p>\n<p>This time, the company is trying something different: using a cheaper body but including the features &#8212; Face ID and an edge-to-edge screen &#8212; that consumers most prize.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"attachments\"><\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 26, 2018","published":"2018-02-26 03:58:41","updated":"2018-02-26

These studios controlled the financial and technical resources necessary to create content and, as a result, had enormous leverage over distributors: the movie theaters, television channels, video sellers, and other middlemen who delivered entertainment to consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this traditional environment, a merger between Time Warner (a leading content producer) and AT&amp;T (a dominant content distributor) could be a threat to competition. As the DOJ\u2019s complaint against the merger argues, the resulting conglomerate might \u201cuse its control of Time Warner\u2019s popular programming as a weapon to harm competition\u201d by raising the prices it charges other cable networks for Time Warner entertainment or limiting distribution of content from other producers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The problem with applying this narrative to today\u2019s market is that it ignores three recent transformations that have forever <a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/k_drCM8X8WFEMZ1kURc4qL?domain=wsj.com\"><span class=\"s2\">shifted power<\/span><\/a> in the entertainment industry. First, whereas studios once controlled the tools and resources necessary to create content, professional-level production tools are now available to anyone with a laptop and a few hundred dollars to spare. This democratization of content creation has resulted in an explosion of creative voices producing entertainment. Second, new channels have arisen to accommodate these new storytellers. Google\u2019s YouTube fostered a generation of homegrown stars, and streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon offer a wide array of original content. Whereas a handful of major television networks once decided what shows viewers would watch and when they would watch them, today\u2019s consumers can access almost any type of content they desire, at any time, on any device. Third, the digitization of content has led to widespread piracy, eroding the profitably of Hollywood\u2019s once stable business model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Together these changes have shifted market power away from the firms that own content toward the digital platforms that control a new scarce resource: the customer. The ability to command viewer attention and use data to better target and serve consumers is now the lifeblood of the entertainment industry. While content creators once held the power, they now serve as suppliers to the increasingly dominant digital distributors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why major studios that faced very little market entry for over a century are now confronting significant threats from firms like Netflix, Amazon (via Prime), and Google (via YouTube), as well as potential content plays from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:FB\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:AAPL\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> on the horizon.

While quashing traditional media mergers like the one between AT&amp;T and Time Warner might produce greater competition and lower cable costs for a few years, it will cement control over the future of the entertainment industry in the hands of a few large technology companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The DOJ appears to be refereeing the game based on an old set of rules that no longer apply. While the agency is worried that the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger could increase the cost of basic cable for those consumers who have yet to cut the cord, they should be far more concerned about ensuring competition in the new online distribution space. Their myopic view of competition will ultimately harm consumers in the long run by preventing legacy firms from competing for customers in the new digital entertainment marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Michael D.

Without the carbs, say proponents, the body burns stored fat instead through a process called ketosis.<\/p>\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2716748\/\">studies<\/a> that back up the theory. One monitored 83 obese patients over a 24-week period, finding significant weight loss and lower cholesterol levels. Experts do say you should check with your doctor before embarking on the keto diet, however.<\/p>\n<p>Keto&#8217;s not a diet for people who aren&#8217;t dedicated. While it doesn\u2019t ban carbs outright, it is very strict on their consumption. Instead, it encourages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/diet-nutrition\/ketogenic-diet\/comprehensive-ketogenic-diet-food-list-follow\/\">\u201cliberal\u201d amounts<\/a> of avocado (sorry <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/19\/avocado-toast-millennials-savings-travel\/\">not on toast<\/a>), cheese, walnuts, almonds, and grass-fed beef.<\/p>\n<p>None of those foods are cheap. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/go\/international\/avocado-prices-demand-harvest\/\">Avocado prices have surged<\/a> in the past year.

And now the price to build a home is coming down.<\/p>\n<p>At SXSW on Sunday, an Austin, Texas-based startup called ICON unveiled its plan to print a 650-square-foot house. According to The Verge, which earlier <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/12\/17101856\/3d-printed-housing-icon-shelter-housing-crisis\">reported<\/a> on ICON&#8217;s concept, the 3D-printed house would be made of cement and take up to one day to be printed by large 3D robots. Best of all, the homes would cost just $10,000. And ICON hopes that eventually, it can bring the cost of homes down to $4,000.<\/p>\n<p>According to the report, ICON is focused on bringing affordable housing to the estimated 1.2 billion people around the world who do not have adequate shelter. The company will begin its mission in El Salvador, where it plans to build 100 of its houses sometime in 2019. The company hopes to bring its housing to move countries in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In order to 3D print a building, however, ICON needs to create a schematic. It will then place that schematic into a computer that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/27\/mit-robot-3d-printing-building\/\">tells its massive printer<\/a> how and where to place the cement. According to The Verge, ICON can print homes up to 800 square feet. Its first model has a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It also features a porch.<\/p>\n<p>Many industry experts say <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/12\/hp-3d-printing-metals\/\">3D printing<\/a> is already revolutionizing the way products are created and will only continue to do so in the future. The printers are capable of using any number of materials\u2014including food, cement, and others\u2014and creating a 3D structure.<\/p>\n<p>In homes, small 3D printers can be used to create toys for kids. In the medical space, 3D printers are believed to be a panacea for creating cheaper prosthetics. In housing, the cheap construction could be a boon for affordable housing.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"March 12, 2018","published":"2018-03-12 10:06:53","updated":"2018-03-12 10:06:53","minute":"10:06
